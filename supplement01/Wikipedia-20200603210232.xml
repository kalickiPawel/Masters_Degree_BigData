[[File:Azimuth-Altitude schematic.svg|right|thumb|The azimuth is the angle formed between a reference direction (in this example north) and a [[sightline|line]] from the observer to a point of interest projected on the same plane as the reference direction orthogonal to the [[zenith]].]]
{{Astrodynamics}}
An '''azimuth''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-azimuth.ogg|ˈ|æ|z|ɪ|m|ə|θ}}; from Arabic اَلسُّمُوت ''as-sumūt'', 'the directions', the plural form of the Arabic noun السَّمْت ''as-samt'', meaning 'the direction') is an [[Angle#Measuring angles|angular measurement]] in a [[spherical coordinate system]]. The [[vector space|vector]] from an observer ([[origin (mathematics)|origin]]) to a point of interest is [[graphical projection|projected]] [[perpendicular]]ly onto a [[reference plane]]; the angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth.

When used as a [[horizontal coordinate system|celestial coordinate]], the azimuth is the [[horizon]]tal direction of a [[star]] or other [[astronomical object]] in the [[sky]]. The star is the point of interest, the reference plane is the local area (e.g. a circular area 5&amp;nbsp;km in radius at [[sea level]]) around an observer on [[planetary surface|Earth's surface]], and the reference vector points to [[true north]]. The azimuth is the angle between the north vector and the star's vector on the [[horizontal plane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/azimuth |title=Azimuth |work=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azimuth is usually measured in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (°). The concept is used in [[navigation]], [[astrometry|astronomy]], [[engineering]], [[map]]ping, mining, and [[ballistics]].

==Navigation==
[[File:True North Mount Allen.fw.png|thumb|left|Azimuth Marker, Mount Allen ([[Sandstone Peak]]), Southern California, USA.]] In land navigation, azimuth is usually denoted [[alpha]], ''α'', and defined as a horizontal angle measured [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]] from a north base line or ''[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21–26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (7 May 1993), ch. 6, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21–26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (28 March 1956), ch. 3, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; ''Azimuth'' has also been more generally defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from any fixed reference plane or easily established base direction line.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ch. 6 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C. (17 September 1941), pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C. (23 December 1944), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the reference plane for an azimuth is typically [[true north]], measured as a 0° azimuth, though other angular units ([[grad (angle)|grad]], [[Angular mil|mil]]) can be used. Moving clockwise on a 360 degree circle, east has azimuth 90°, south 180°, and west 270°. There are exceptions: some navigation systems use south as the reference vector. Any direction can be the reference vector, as long as it is clearly defined.

Quite commonly, azimuths or compass bearings are stated in a system in which either north or south can be the zero, and the angle may be measured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero. For example, a bearing might be described as "(from) south, (turn) thirty degrees (toward the) east" (the words in brackets are usually omitted), abbreviated "S30°E", which is the bearing 30 degrees in the eastward direction from south, i.e. the bearing 150 degrees clockwise from north. The reference direction, stated first, is always north or south, and the turning direction, stated last, is east or west. The directions are chosen so that the angle, stated between them, is positive, between zero and 90 degrees. If the bearing happens to be exactly in the direction of one of the [[cardinal point]]s, a different notation, e.g. "due east", is used instead.

==Cartographical azimuth==
[[File:Brunton.JPG|thumb|right|A standard Brunton Geo [[compass]], commonly used by geologists and surveyors to measure azimuth]]
The cartographical azimuth (in decimal degrees) can be calculated when the coordinates of 2 points are known in a flat plane ([[Spatial reference system|cartographical coordinates]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{180}{\pi} \operatorname{atan2}(X_2 - X_1, Y_2 - Y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

Remark that the reference axes are swapped relative to the (counterclockwise) mathematical [[polar coordinate system]] and that the azimuth is clockwise relative to the north.
This is the reason why the X and Y axis in the above formula are swapped.
If the azimuth becomes negative, one can always add 360°.

The formula in [[radian]]s would be slightly easier:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \operatorname{atan2}(X_2 - X_1, Y_2 - Y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

Note the swapped &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; in contrast to the normal &lt;math&gt;(y, x)&lt;/math&gt; [[atan2]] input order.

===Calculating coordinates===
When the coordinates (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of one point, the distance ''D'', and the azimuth ''α'' to another point (''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are known, one can calculate its coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  X_2 &amp;= X_1 + D \sin\alpha \\
  Y_2 &amp;= Y_1 + D \cos\alpha
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is typically used in [[triangulation]] and azimuth identification (AzID), especially in [[radar]] applications.

==Calculating azimuth==
[[File:Bearing and azimuth along the geodesic.png|thumb|The azimuth between [[Cape Town]] and [[Melbourne]] along the [[geodesic]] (the shortest route) changes from 141° to 42°. [[Orthographic projection in cartography|Azimuthal orthographic projection]] and [[Miller cylindrical projection]].]]
We are standing at latitude &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1&lt;/math&gt;, longitude zero; we want to find the azimuth from our viewpoint to Point 2 at latitude &lt;math&gt;\varphi_2&lt;/math&gt;, longitude ''L'' (positive eastward). We can get a fair approximation by assuming the Earth is a sphere, in which case the azimuth ''α'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha = \frac{\sin L}{\cos\varphi_1 \tan\varphi_2 - \sin\varphi_1 \cos L}&lt;/math&gt;

A better approximation assumes the Earth is a slightly-squashed sphere (an ''[[oblate spheroid]]''); ''azimuth'' then has at least two very slightly different meanings. ''Normal-section azimuth'' is the angle measured at our viewpoint by a theodolite whose axis is perpendicular to the surface of the spheroid; ''geodetic azimuth'' is the angle between north and the ''geodesic''; that is, the shortest path on the surface of the spheroid from our viewpoint to Point 2. The difference is usually immeasurably small; if Point 2 is not more than 100&amp;nbsp;km away, the difference will not exceed 0.03 arc second.

Various websites will calculate geodetic azimuth; e.g., [http://www.ga.gov.au/geodesy/datums/vincenty_inverse.jsp GeoScience Australia site]. Formulas for calculating geodetic azimuth are linked in the [[Geographical distance#Ellipsoidal-surface formulae|distance article]].

Normal-section azimuth is simpler to calculate; Bomford says Cunningham's formula is exact for any distance.{{citation needed|reason=No mention of (Guy) Bomford or Cunningham anywhere else on this page|date=September 2015}} If ''f'' is the flattening, and ''e'' the eccentricity, for the chosen spheroid (e.g., {{frac|{{val|298.257223563}}}} for [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]]) then

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
         e^2 &amp;= f(2 - f) \\
     1 - e^2 &amp;= (1 - f)^2 \\
     \Lambda &amp;= \left(1 - e^2\right) \frac{\tan\varphi_2}{\tan\varphi_1} + e^2
       \sqrt{\frac{1 + \left(1 - e^2\right)\left(\tan\varphi_2\right)^2}
                  {1 + \left(1 - e^2\right)\left(\tan\varphi_1\right)^2}} \\
  \tan\alpha &amp;= \frac{\sin L}{(\Lambda - \cos L)\sin\varphi_1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 then

: &lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha = \frac{\sin L}{\left(1 - e^2\right)\tan\varphi_2}&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate the azimuth of the sun or a star given its declination and hour angle at our location, we modify the formula for a spherical earth. Replace ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with declination and longitude difference with hour angle, and change the sign (since the hour angle is positive westward instead of east).

==Mapping==
There is a wide variety of [[Map projection#Azimuthal .28projections onto a plane.29|azimuthal map projections]]. They all have the property that directions (the azimuths) from a central point are preserved. Some navigation systems use south as the reference plane. However, any direction can serve as the plane of reference, as long as it is clearly defined for everyone using that system.

==Astronomy==
Used in celestial navigation, an ''azimuth'' is the direction of a celestial body from the observer.&lt;ref&gt;Rutstrum, Carl, The Wilderness Route Finder, University of Minnesota Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-8166-3661-3}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; In astronomy, an ''azimuth'' is sometimes referred to as a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]]. In modern [[astronomy]] azimuth is nearly always measured from the north.
(The article on [[Celestial coordinate system|coordinate systems]], for example, uses a convention measuring from the south.) In former times, it was common to refer to azimuth from the south, as it was then zero at the same time that the [[hour angle]] of a [[star]] was zero. This assumes, however, that the star [[culmination|(upper) culminates]] in the south, which is only true if the star's [[declination]] is less than (i.e. further south than) the observer's [[latitude]].

==Other systems==

===Right ascension===
If, instead of measuring from and along the horizon, the angles are measured from and along the [[celestial equator]], the angles are called [[right ascension]] if referenced to the Vernal Equinox, or hour angle if referenced to the [[celestial meridian]].

===Horizontal coordinate===
In the [[horizontal coordinate system]], used in [[celestial navigation]] and [[satellite dish]] installation, azimuth is one of the two [[coordinate system|coordinates]]. The other is [[Altitude (astronomy)|altitude]], sometimes called elevation above the horizon. See also: [[Sat finder]].

===Polar coordinate===
In mathematics, the azimuth angle of a point in [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]] or [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] is the anticlockwise [[angle]] between the positive ''x''-axis and the projection of the [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] onto the ''xy''-[[plane (mathematics)|plane]]. The angle is the same as an angle in [[polar coordinates]] of the component of the vector in the ''xy''-plane and is normally measured in [[radian]]s rather than degrees. As well as measuring the angle differently, in mathematical applications [[theta]], ''θ'', is very often used to represent the azimuth rather than the representation of symbol  [[phi (letter)|phi]] ''φ''.

==Other uses of the word==
For [[tape drive|magnetic tape drives]], ''azimuth'' refers to the angle between the tape head(s) and tape.

In [[sound localization]] experiments and literature, the ''azimuth'' refers to the angle the sound source makes compared to the imaginary straight line that is drawn from within the head through the area between the eyes.

An [[azimuth thruster]] in [[shipbuilding]] is a [[propeller]] that can be rotated horizontally.

==Etymology of the word==
The word azimuth is in all European languages today. It originates from medieval Arabic ''al-sumūt'', pronounced ''as-sumūt'' in Arabic, meaning "the directions" (plural of Arabic ''al-samt'' = "the direction"). The Arabic word entered late medieval Latin in an astronomy context and in particular in the use of the Arabic version of the [[astrolabe]] astronomy instrument. The word's first record in English is in the 1390s in ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. The first known record in any Western language is in Spanish in the 1270s in an astronomy book that was largely derived from Arabic sources, the ''[[Libros del saber de astronomía]]'' commissioned by [[King Alfonso X]] of Castile.&lt;ref&gt;"Azimuth" at [https://archive.org/stream/oed01arch#page/602/mode/1up ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'']; "azimut" at [http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/azimut ''Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales'']; "al-Samt" at [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-samt-SIM_6591 ''Brill's Encyclopedia of Islam'']; "azimuth" at [http://englishwordsofarabicancestry.wordpress.com/#cite_note-39 EnglishWordsOfArabicAncestry.wordpress.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102020035/http://englishwordsofarabicancestry.wordpress.com/#cite_note-39 |date=January 2, 2014 }}. In Arabic the written ''al-sumūt'' is always pronounced ''as-sumūt'' (see [[Sun and moon letters|pronunciation of "al-" in Arabic]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Units ==
The IAU(1976) system is based on the [[astronomical system of units]]:
* The astronomical unit of ''time'' is the day ('''D''') of 86,400 [[SI]] [[second]]s, which is close to the mean [[solar day]] of civil clock time.
* The astronomical unit of ''mass'' is the mass of the Sun ('''S''').
* The astronomical unit of ''length'' is known as '''the''' [[astronomical unit]] ('''A''' or '''au'''), which in the IAU(1976) system is defined as the length for which the [[gravitational constant]], more specifically the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] '''k''' expressed in the astronomical units (''i.e.'' k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has units A&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;), takes the value of {{nowrap|0.017 202 098 95}} .  This astronomical unit is approximately the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun.  The value of '''k''' is the [[angular velocity]] in radians per day ('''i.e.''' the daily [[mean motion]]) of an infinitesimally small mass that moves around the Sun in a circular orbit at a distance of 1 AU.

A '''hypothetical astronomical object''' is an [[astronomical object]] (such as a [[star]], [[planet]] or [[natural satellite|moon]]) that is believed or speculated to exist or to have existed but whose existence has not been scientifically proven. Such objects have been hypothesized throughout [[recorded history]]. For example, in the 5th century BCE, the philosopher [[Philolaus]] defined a hypothetical astronomical object which he called the "[[Central Fire]]", around which he proposed other celestial bodies (including the Sun) moved.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Ceccarelli, ''Distinguished Figures in Mechanism and Machine Science'' (2007), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of hypothetical astronomical objects==
Hypothetical astronomical objects have been speculated to exist both inside and outside of the [[Solar System]], and speculation has included different kinds of stars, planets, and other astronomical objects.
* For hypothetical astronomical objects in the Solar System, see: [[List of hypothetical Solar System objects]]
* For hypothetical stars, see [[Hypothetical star]]
* For hypothetical [[brown dwarf]]s, see: [[List of brown dwarfs#Unconfirmed brown dwarfs|List of brown dwarfs]]
* For hypothetical black holes, see: [[Hypothetical black hole (disambiguation)|Hypothetical black hole]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;
* For extrasolar moons, all of which are currently hypothetical, see: [[Extrasolar moon]]
* For stars, planets or moons whose existence is not accepted by science see: [[Planetary objects proposed in religion, astrology, ufology and pseudoscience]] and [[Stars proposed in religion]]
* For hypothetical planets in fiction see: [[Fictional planets of the Solar System]]

==Hypothetical planet types==

Hypothetical types of extrasolar planet include:

*[[Carbon planet]]: a [[terrestrial planet]] composed primarily of carbon, rather than silicon
*[[Chthonian planet]]: A [[hot Jupiter]] whose outer layers have been completely stripped off by its parent star
*[[Coreless planet]]: A terrestrial planet that has no metallic [[Core (geology)|core]]
*[[Helium planet]]: a [[gas giant]] planet formed around a [[white dwarf]] star that is composed mainly of helium instead of hydrogen
*[[Iron planet]], a planet like [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] that consists mainly of an iron core with little mantle
*[[Ocean planet]]: A planet whose surface is covered entirely by deep oceans
*[[Ploonet]]: A planet that was originally a moon but has become gravitationally detached. Similarly, Pluto was once thought to be an escaped satellite of Neptune.  
*[[Trojan planet]]: A planet that orbits with a star instead of around it

      <text bytes="2951" xml:space="preserve">The '''blanketing effect''' (also referred to as '''line blanketing''' or the '''line-blanketing effect''') is the enhancement of the [[red]] or [[infrared]] regions of a [[stellar spectrum]] at the expense of the other regions, with an overall diminishing effect on the whole spectrum. The term originates in a 1928 article by astrophysicist [[Edward Arthur Milne]], where it was used to describe the effects that the [[metallicity|astronomical metals]] in a star's outer regions had on that star's spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1928Obs....51...88M|volume=51|pages=88&amp;ndash;96|title=The total absorption in the Sun's reversing layer|journal=The Observatory|author=Milne, E. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name arose because the absorption lines act as a "blanket", causing the continuum temperature of the spectrum to rise over what it would have been if these lines were not present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|pages=278&amp;ndash;296|title=On the existence of subdwarfs in the (M&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt;, log T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;)-diagram|bibcode=1959MNRAS.119..278S|last1=Sandage |first1=Allan R.|last2=Eggen|first2=Olin J.|doi=10.1093/mnras/119.3.278 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomical metals, which produce most of a star's spectral [[absorption line]]s, absorb a fraction of the star's [[radiant energy]] (a phenomenon known as the ''blocking effect'') and then re-emit it at a lower frequency as part of the ''backwarming'' effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Pachart Publishing House|title=Multicolor Stellar Photometry|year=1992|location=Tucson|author=Straižys, Vytautas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of both these effects results in the position of stars in a [[color-color diagram]] to shift towards redder areas as the proportion of ''metals'' in them increases. The blanketing effect is thus highly dependent on the [[metallicity]] index of a star, which indicates the fraction of elements other than hydrogen and helium that compose it.

      <text bytes="3859" xml:space="preserve">'''Instrumental magnitude''' refers to an uncalibrated [[apparent magnitude]], and, like its counterpart, it refers to the [[brightness]] of an astronomical object seen from an observer on [[Earth]], but unlike its counterpart, it is only useful in relative comparisons to other astronomical objects in the same image (assuming the photometric calibration does not spatially vary across the image; in the case of images from the Palomar Transient Factory, the absolute photometric calibration involves a zero point that varies over the image by up to 0.16 magnitudes to make a required illumination correction&lt;ref name=ofek2012/&gt;).  Instrumental magnitude is defined in various ways, and so when working with instrumental magnitudes, it is important to know how they are defined.  The most basic definition of instrumental magnitude, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;m = -2.5 \log_{10}(f)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the intensity of the source object in known physical units.  For example, in the paper by Mighell,&lt;ref name=mighell1999/&gt; it was assumed that the data are in units of electron number (generated within pixels of a charge-coupled device).  The physical units of the source intensity are thus part of the definition required for any instrumental magnitudes that are employed.  The factor of 2.5 in the above formula originates from the established fact that the human eye can only clearly distinguish the brightness of two objects if one is at least approximately 2.5 times brighter than the other.&lt;ref name=harwit1982/&gt;
The instrumental magnitude is defined such that two objects with a brightness ratio of exactly 100 will differ by precisely 5 magnitudes, and this is based on [[N. R. Pogson|Pogson]]'s system of defining each successive magnitude as being fainter by &lt;math&gt;100^{1/5}&lt;/math&gt;.  We can now relate this to the base-10 logarithmic function and the leading coefficient in the above formula:

:&lt;math&gt;100^{1/5}=(10^2)^{1/5}=10^{2/5}=10^{0.4} = 2.51188643 \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

The approximate value of 2.5 is used as a convenience, its negative sign assures that brighter objects will have smaller and possibly negative values, and tabulated values of base-10 [[logarithms]] were available more than three centuries before the advent of computers and calculators.

It is on the [[celestial equator]] at both the left and right extremes of the [[star chart|sky chart]], with the [[ecliptic]] (the orange dotted [[sine wave|sine curve]]) passing through it.]]

The '''First Point of Aries''', also known as the '''Cusp of Aries''', is the location of the [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|vernal equinox]], used as a reference point in [[celestial coordinate system]]s. In diagrams using such coordinate systems, it is often indicated with the symbol ♈︎. Named for the [[constellation]] of [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]], it is one of the two points on the [[celestial sphere]] at which the [[celestial equator]] crosses the [[ecliptic]], the other being the [[First Point of Libra]], located exactly 180° from it. Due to [[axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]] since the position was originally named in antiquity, the [[position of the Sun]] on the [[March equinox]] is now in [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], while that on the [[September equinox]] is in [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] (as of [[epoch (astronomy)|J2000]]).

Along its yearly path through the [[zodiac]], the [[Sun]] meets the celestial equator from south to north at the First Point of Aries, and from north to south at the First Point of Libra. The First Point of Aries is considered to be the celestial "[[prime meridian]]" from which [[right ascension]] is calculated.

==History==
[[File:Equinozio da Pizzo Vento,tramonto fondachelli fantina, sicilia.JPG|thumb|equinox seen from the site of Pizzo Vento at [[Fondachelli-Fantina]], [[Sicily]]]]
The choice of starting position from which to measure the Sun's motion across celestial sphere is arbitrary. The equinoxes are preferred as an equinox marks the point in time when the Sun has neither northern nor southern declination but is crossing the celestial equator. Of the two possible equinoxes the ancient Greeks chose the March equinox as the starting point.  This coincided with the festival of [[Hilaria]], a time of optimism and beginnings where farmers began to sow or observed the first growth and blossoming of trees and summer crops.&lt;ref&gt;R Turcan. 1996. The Cults of the Roman Empire. p44-47&lt;/ref&gt;  The naming of [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] is late in the [[Babylonian zodiac]] where the equinox was in its earliest tradition marked as in the early [[Middle Bronze Age]] by actual coincidence with the [[Pleiades]].{{sfn|Rogers, ''Mesopotamian Traditions''|1998}} The time also corresponds to the time of [[castration]] of male calves, mules and donkeys, ''Sanguia'' on the vernal equinox and marked the start of spring proper.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Aries: The Ram}}{{sfn|Winterburn|2008|pp=230–231}}{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=84–85}}

The First Point of Aries is so called because, when [[Hipparchus]] defined it in 130 BCE, it was located in the western extreme of the constellation of Aries, near its border with [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] and the star [[Gamma Arietis|γ Arietis]]. Due to the [[Sun]]'s eastward movement across the sky throughout the year, this western end of Aries was the point at which the Sun entered the constellation, hence the name ''First Point'' of Aries.

==Definition==
Due to Earth's [[axial precession]], this point gradually moves westwards at a rate of about one degree every 72 years. This means that, since the time of Hipparchus, it has shifted across the sky by about 30°, and is currently located within Pisces, near its border with [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April until mid-May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of the northern spring.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Aries: The Ram}}{{sfn|Winterburn|2008|pp=230–231}}{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=84–85}}

The First Point of Aries is important to the fields of astronomy, nautical navigation and astrology. [[Nautical almanac|Navigational ephemeris tables]] record the geographic position of the First Point of Aries as the reference for position of navigational stars. Due to the slow [[Precession (astronomy)|precession of the equinoxes]], the [[Zenith]] view (above a location) of constellations at a time of year from a given location have slowly moved west (by using solar [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]s the drift is known). The [[tropical Zodiac]] is similarly affected and no longer corresponds with the [[constellation]]s (the Cusp of Libra today is located within [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]). In [[sidereal astrology]], by contrast, the first point of Aries remains aligned with the Aries constellation.

[[Image:Ley lines.svg|thumb|300px|right|80 4-point near-alignments of 137 random points]]

'''Alignments of random points in a plane''' can be demonstrated by [[statistics]] to be [[counter-intuitively]] easy to find when a large number of [[randomness|random]] points are marked on a bounded flat surface.  This has been put forward as a demonstration that [[ley line]]s and other similar mysterious alignments believed by some to be phenomena of deep significance might exist solely due to chance alone, as opposed to the supernatural or anthropological explanations put forward by their proponents. The topic has also been studied in the fields of [[computer vision]] and [[astronomy]].

A number of studies have examined the mathematics of alignment of random points on the plane.&lt;ref&gt;"Alignments in Two-Dimensional Random Sets of Points"
David G. Kendall and Wilfrid S. Kendall
''Advances in Applied Probability''
Vol. 12, No. 2 (Jun., 1980), pp. 380-424

It allows the fact that real-world features are not mathematical points, and that their positions need not line up exactly for them to be considered in alignment. [[Alfred Watkins]], in his classic work on ley lines ''[[The Old Straight Track]]'', used the width of a pencil line on a map as the threshold for the tolerance of what might be regarded as an alignment. For example, using a 1&amp;nbsp;mm pencil line to draw alignments on a 1:50,000 [[Ordnance Survey]] map, the corresponding width on the ground would be 50 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9780349137070 | title = The Old Straight Track: Its Mounds, Beacons, Moats, Sites and Mark Stones | last1 = Watkins | first1 = Alfred | date = 1988 | publisher = Abacus  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimate of probability of chance alignments ==
[[Contrary to intuition]], finding alignments between randomly placed points on a landscape gets progressively easier as the geographic area to be considered increases. One way of understanding this phenomenon is to see that the increase in the number of possible [[combination]]s of sets of points in that area overwhelms the decrease in the probability that any given set of points in that area line up.

One definition which expresses the generally accepted meaning of "alignment" is:
:''A set of points, chosen from a given set of landmark points, all of which lie within at least one straight path of a given width''

More precisely, a path of width ''w'' may be defined as the set of all points within a distance of ''w/2'' of a [[straight line]] on a plane, or a [[great circle]] on a sphere, or in general any [[geodesic]] on any other kind of [[manifold]].  Note that, in general, any given set of points that are aligned in this way will contain a large number of infinitesimally different straight paths.  Therefore, only the existence of at least one straight path is necessary to determine whether a set of points is an alignment. For this reason, it is easier to count the sets of points, rather than the paths themselves.
The number of alignments found is very sensitive to the allowed width ''w'', increasing approximately proportionately to ''w''&lt;sup&gt;''k''-2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''k'' is the number of points in an alignment.

The following is a very approximate order-of-magnitude estimate of the likelihood of alignments, assuming a plane covered with uniformly distributed "significant" points.

Consider a set of ''n'' points in a compact area with approximate diameter ''L'' and area approximately ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Consider a valid line to be one where every point is within distance ''w''/2 of the line (that is, lies on a track of width ''w'', where ''w'' ≪ ''L'').

Consider all the unordered sets of ''k'' points from the ''n'' points, of which there are:

:&lt;math&gt;\binom nk = \frac {n!} {(n-k)!\,k!}&lt;/math&gt;

(see [[factorial]] and [[binomial coefficient]] for notation).

To make a rough estimate of the probability that any given subset of ''k'' points is approximately [[collinearity|collinear]] in the way defined above, consider the line between the "leftmost" and "rightmost" two points in that set (for some arbitrary left/right axis: we can choose top and bottom for the exceptional vertical case). These two points are by definition on this line. For each of the remaining ''k''-2 points, the probability that the point is "near enough" to the line is roughly ''w''/''L'', which can be seen by considering the ratio of the area of the line tolerance zone (roughly ''wL'') and the overall area (roughly ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

So, the expected number of k-point alignments, by this definition, is very roughly:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {n!} {(n-k)!\,k!} \left({\frac{w}{L}}\right)^{k-2}&lt;/math&gt;

Among other things this can be used to show that, contrary to intuition, the number of k-point lines expected from random chance in a plane covered with points at a given density, for a given line width, increases much more than linearly with the size of the area considered, since the [[combinatorial explosion]] of growth in the number of possible combinations of points more than makes up for the increase in difficulty of any given combination lining up.

== More precise estimate of expected number of alignments ==

A more precise expression for the number of 3-point alignments of maximum width ''w'' and maximum length ''d'' expected by chance among ''n'' points placed randomly on a square of side ''L'' is &lt;ref name=edmunds&gt;Edmunds, M.G. &amp; George, G.H., ''Random Alignment of Quasars'',  Nature, vol. 290, pages 481-483, 1981 April 9&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac {\pi } {3} \frac {w}{L} 
 \left( {\frac {d}{L}} \right)^{3} n \left( n-1 \right) 
 \left( n-2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

If edge effects (alignments lost over the boundaries of the square) are included, then the expression becomes
:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac {\pi } {3} \frac {w}{L} 
 \left( {\frac {d}{L}} \right)^{3} n \left( n-1 \right) 
 \left( n-2 \right) 
 \left( 1 - \frac {3}{\pi } \left( \frac {d}{L} \right) 
 + \frac {3}{5} \left( \frac {4}{\pi } - 1 \right) 
 \left( \frac {d}{L} \right)^{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

A generalisation to ''k''-point alignments (ignoring edge effects) is&lt;ref name=george&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~ggeorge/astron/thesis.html |title=Ph.D. Thesis of Glyn George: The Alignment and Clustering of Quasars|first1 = G.H |last1= George | date=2003-08-03|accessdate=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac {\pi n \left( n-1 \right) \left( n-2 \right)  
 \cdots \left( n - \left( k-1 \right) \right) } 
 {k \left( k-2 \right) !} \left( \frac {w}{L} \right)^{k-2} 
 \left( {\frac {d}{L}} \right)^{k}  &lt;/math&gt;
which has roughly similar asymptotic scaling properties as the crude approximation in the previous section, with combinatorial explosion for large ''n'' overwhelming the effects of other variables.

== Computer simulation of alignments ==
[[image:leylines.png|thumb|300px|right|607 4-point alignments of 269 random points]]
[[Computer simulation]]s show that points on a plane tend to form alignments similar to those found by ley hunters in numbers consistent with the order-of-magnitude estimates above, suggesting that ley lines may also be generated by chance.  This phenomenon occurs regardless of whether the points are generated pseudo-randomly by computer, or from data sets of mundane features such as pizza restaurants or telephone booths.

It is easy to find alignments of 4 to 8 points in reasonably small data sets with ''w'' = 50 m.
Choosing large areas or larger values of ''w'' makes it easy to find alignments of 20 or more points.

{{astrology}}
[[Astrology]] consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. [[Astrology#Scientific appraisal|Scientific testing]] has found no evidence  to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt;

Where astrology has made [[falsifiable]] predictions, it has been falsified.&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt;{{rp|424}} The most famous test was headed by [[Shawn Carlson]] and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led to the conclusion that [[natal astrology]] performed no better than chance. Astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin claimed to have found statistical support for "the [[Mars effect]]" in the birth dates of athletes, but it could not be replicated in further studies.&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt;{{rp|213–214}}  The organisers of later studies claimed that Gauquelin had tried to influence their inclusion criteria for the study by suggesting specific individuals be removed. It has also been suggested, by Geoffrey Dean, that the reporting of birth times by parents (before the 1950s) may have caused the apparent effect.

Astrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in [[Empiricism|controlled studies]] and has no scientific validity,&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cosmic /&gt;{{rp|85}} and is thus regarded as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=SandPSandAstroSoc /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartmann /&gt;{{rp|1350}} There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth in the way astrologers say they do that does not contradict well-understood, basic aspects of [[biology]] and [[physics]].&lt;ref name= Vishveshwara /&gt;{{rp|249}}&lt;ref name=AsquithNSF /&gt;

==Introduction==

The majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator's future.&lt;ref name=Cosmic /&gt;{{rp|83}} Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so "in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary".&lt;ref name=Humanist /&gt; [[Astrophysicist]] [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] commented on astrological belief, saying that "part of knowing how to think is knowing how the laws of nature shape the world around us. Without that knowledge, without that capacity to think, you can easily become a victim of people who seek to take advantage of you".&lt;ref name=Post /&gt;

The continued belief in astrology despite its lack of credibility is seen as one demonstration of low [[scientific literacy]].&lt;ref name=Allum /&gt;

==Historical relationship with astronomy==
{{main|astrology and astronomy}}

The foundations of the theoretical structure used in astrology originate with the Babylonians, although widespread usage did not occur till the start of the [[Hellenistic period]] after Alexander the Great swept through Greece. It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a [[celestial sphere]] and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is, is cultural, and varied between civilisations.&lt;ref name=Massimo /&gt;{{rp|62}} [[Ptolemy]]'s work on [[astronomy]] was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.&lt;ref name=Hoskin /&gt;{{rp|40}} Early western astrology operated under the [[ancient Greek]] concepts of the [[Macrocosm and microcosm]]; and thus [[medical astrology]] related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.&lt;ref name=Hoskin /&gt;{{rp|73}} While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt;{{rp|344}}

During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the sun's orbit, required for the [[Geocentric model#Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic model]] could be calculated to a sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] [[vizier]] in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.&lt;ref name=Hoskin /&gt;{{rp|55–56}} Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.&lt;ref name=Hoskin /&gt;{{rp|57}}

The clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication [[Connaissance des Temps|La Connoissance des temps]].&lt;ref name=Hoskin /&gt;{{rp|220}} Unlike the west, in Iran, the rejection of [[heliocentrism]] continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and [[Cosmology in medieval Islam|Islamic cosmology]] in Iran.&lt;ref name=Iran /&gt;{{rp|10}} The first work, Falak al-sa'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and "old astronomy" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a [[Conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]], and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.&lt;ref name=Iran /&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

==Philosophy of science==
[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumbnail|Philosopher Karl Popper proposed falsifiability as ideas that distinguish science from non-science, using astrology as the example of an idea that has not dealt with falsification during experiment.]]

Astrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.&lt;ref name=Massimo /&gt;{{rp|62}}

===Falsifiability===
Science and [[non-science]] are often distinguished by the criterion of [[falsifiability]]. The criterion was first proposed by [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]]. To Popper, science does not rely on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.&lt;ref name=PopperStanford /&gt;&lt;ref name=Philo /&gt;{{rp|10}}

Therefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=PopperStanford /&gt;

Astrology was Popper's most frequent example of pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=Kuhn /&gt;{{rp|7}} Popper regarded astrology as "pseudo-empirical" in that "it appeals to observation and experiment", but "nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards".&lt;ref name=Popper /&gt;{{rp|44}}

In contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology [[Terence Hines]], this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=Cogan /&gt;{{rp|206}}

==="No puzzles to solve"===
In contrast to Popper, the philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.&lt;ref name=Wright /&gt;{{rp|401}} To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that "categorically failed," this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a [[horoscope]] being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction).

Rather, in Kuhn's eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to [[medieval medicine]]; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,&lt;ref name=Kuhn /&gt;{{rp|8}} and so, "They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."&lt;ref name=Kuhn /&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;ref name=Wright /&gt;{{rp|401}}

While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological [[hypothesis]] in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.&lt;ref name=Kuhn /&gt;{{rp|8}}

===Progress, practice and consistency===
Philosopher [[Paul Thagard]] believed that astrology can not be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|228}} To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be "selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations".&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|227–228}}

Progress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|228}}&lt;ref name=Hurley /&gt;{{rp|549}} To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in [[normal science]] believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the "many unsolved problems", and in the face of better alternative theories (Psychology). For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|228}}

To Thagard, astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin's to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone's career, twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies, lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy's time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|226–227}} Rather, his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci; "theory, community [and] historical context".

While verification and falsifiability focused on the theory, Kuhn's work focused on the historical context, but the astrological community should also be considered. Whether or not they:&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|226–227}}
* are focused on comparing their approach to others.
* have a consistent approach.
* try to falsify their theory through experiment.
In this approach, true falsification rather than modifying a theory to avoid the falsification only really occurs when an alternative theory is proposed.&lt;ref name=Thagard /&gt;{{rp|228}}

===Irrationality===
For the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.&lt;ref name=EdwardJ /&gt;{{rp|34}}

{{quote|What if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational. ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning."|Edward W. James&lt;ref name=EdwardJ /&gt;{{rp|34}}}}

This poor reasoning includes [[appeals to authority|appeals to ancient astrologers]] such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning, and vague claims. The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly "the same place have a life pattern that is very similar" is vague, but also ignores that time is [[Special relativity|reference frame dependent]] and gives no definition of "same place" despite the planet's moving in the reference frame of the solar system. Other comments by astrologers are based on severely erroneous interpretations of basic physics, such as a claim by one astrologer{{Who|date=August 2016}} that the solar system looks like an atom. Further, James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic, an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology, but any differences are due to "heredity and environment", while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology.&lt;ref name=EdwardJ /&gt;{{rp|32}} Further, to astrologers, if something appears in their favour, they latch upon it as proof, while making no attempt to explore its implications, preferring to refer to the item in favour as definitive; possibilities that do not make astrology look favourable are ignored.&lt;ref name=EdwardJ /&gt;{{rp|33}}

===Quinean dichotomy===
From the [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quinean]] web of knowledge, there is a dichotomy where one must either reject astrology or accept astrology but reject all established scientific disciplines that are incompatible with astrology.&lt;ref name=Philo /&gt;{{rp|24}}

==Tests of astrology==
Astrologers often avoid making verifiable predictions, and instead rely on vague statements that let them try to avoid falsification.&lt;ref name=Popper /&gt;{{rp|48–49}} Across several centuries of testing, the predictions of astrology have never been more accurate than that expected by chance alone.&lt;ref name=Cosmic /&gt; One approach used in testing astrology quantitatively is through [[blind experiment]]. When specific predictions from astrologers were tested in rigorous experimental procedures in the Carlson test, the predictions were [[falsifiability|falsified]].&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt; All [[Scientific control|controlled]] experiments have failed to show any effect.&lt;ref name=Philo /&gt;{{rp|24}}

===Carlson's experiment===
Shawn Carlson's now renowned experiment was performed by 28 astrologers matching over 100 natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the [[California Psychological Inventory]] (CPI) test using [[double blind]] methods.

The experimental protocol used in Carlson's study was agreed to by a group of physicists and astrologers prior to the experiment.&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt; Astrologers, nominated by the [[National Council for Geocosmic Research]], acted as the astrological advisors, and helped to ensure, and agreed, that the test was fair.&lt;ref name=CritThink /&gt;{{rp|117}}&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;{{rp|420}} They also chose 26 of the 28 astrologers for the tests, the other 2 being interested astrologers who volunteered afterwards.&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;{{rp|420}} The astrologers came from Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name=CritThink /&gt;{{rp|117}} The astrologers helped to draw up the central proposition of [[natal astrology]] to be tested.&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt;{{rp|419}} Published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1985, the study found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing "clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis".&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

===Dean and Kelly===
Scientist and former astrologer Geoffrey Dean and psychologist Ivan Kelly&lt;ref name=FailToPredict /&gt; conducted a large-scale scientific test, involving more than one hundred [[cognitive]], [[behavioural]], [[physiological|physical]] and other variables, but found no support for astrology.&lt;ref name=Geoffrey /&gt; A further test involved 45 confident{{efn|The level of confidence was self rated by the astrologers themselves.}} astrologers, with an average of 10 years' experience and 160 test subjects (out of an original sample size of 1198 test subjects) who strongly favoured certain characteristics in the [[Eysenck Personality Questionnaire]] to extremes.&lt;ref name=Geoffrey /&gt;{{rp|191}} The astrologers performed much worse than merely basing decisions off the individuals' ages, and much worse than 45 control subjects who did not use birth charts at all.{{efn|Also discussed in {{cite book|last=Martens|first=Ronny|title=Making sense of astrology|year=1998|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=978-1-57392-218-0|author2=Trachet, Tim | author2link=Tim Trachet}}}}&lt;ref name=Geoffrey /&gt;{{rp|191}}

===Other tests===
A [[meta-analysis]] was conducted, pooling 40 studies consisting of 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests, which had a total of 300 participating, involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When the date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart.&lt;ref name=Geoffrey /&gt;{{rp|190}}

In 10 studies, participants picked horoscopes that they felt were accurate descriptions, with one being the "correct" answer. Again the results were no better than chance.&lt;ref name=Massimo /&gt;{{rp|66–67}}

In a study of 2011 sets of people born within 5 minutes of each other ("time twins") to see if there was any discernible effect, no effect was seen.&lt;ref name=Massimo /&gt;{{rp|67}}

Quantitative sociologist [[David Voas]] examined the census data for more than 20&amp;nbsp;million individuals in England and Wales to see if star signs corresponded to marriage arrangements. No effect was seen.&lt;ref name=Massimo /&gt;{{rp|67}}

===Mars effect===
{{main|Mars effect}}
[[File:Mars effect12.jpg|thumb|right|The initial [[Mars effect]] finding, showing the relative frequency of the [[diurnal motion|diurnal position]] of Mars in the birth charts (N = 570) of "eminent athletes" (red solid line) compared to the expected results [after [[Michel Gauquelin]] 1955]&lt;ref name=Gauquelin-1955 /&gt;]]

In 1955, astrologer&lt;ref name=Pont /&gt; and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that although he had failed to find evidence to support such indicators as the [[Astrological signs|zodiacal signs]] and [[Astrological aspects|planetary aspects]] in astrology, he had found positive correlations between the [[Diurnal motion|diurnal positions]] of some of the [[Planets in astrology|planets]] and success in professions (such as doctors, scientists, athletes, actors, writers, painters, etc.), which astrology traditionally associates with those planets.&lt;ref name="Gauquelin-1955" /&gt; The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the [[natal chart]]s of successful athletes and became known as the "[[Mars effect]]".&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt;{{rp|213}} A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence.&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt;{{rp|213–214}} They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.&lt;ref name=Benski /&gt;

Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession. The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations,{{efn|Gauquelin attributed this phenomenon to the increase in "artificial" birth hours due to the increased use of surgery to deliver babies (''C'est écrit dans les astres'', p. 240 &amp; ''Les Horloges cosmiques'' p. 200).}} where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information. The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating more evidence that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs.&lt;ref name=CritThink/&gt;{{rp|116}}

==Theoretic obstacles==
Beyond the scientific tests astrology has failed, proposals for astrology face a number of other obstacles due to the many theoretical flaws in astrology&lt;ref name=Massimo /&gt;{{rp|62}}&lt;ref name=Philo /&gt;{{rp|24}} including lack of consistency, lack of ability to predict missing planets, lack of any connection of the zodiac to the constellations, and lack of any plausible mechanism. The underpinnings of astrology tend to disagree with numerous basic facts from scientific disciplines.&lt;ref name=Philo /&gt;{{rp|24}}

===Lack of consistency===
Testing the validity of astrology can be difficult because there is no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict.&lt;ref name=Cosmic /&gt;{{rp|83}} Dean and Kelly documented 25 studies, which had found that the [[Inter-rater reliability|degree of agreement]] amongst astrologers' predictions was measured as a low 0.1.{{efn|0.8 is generally seen as unreliable within the [[social sciences]]&lt;ref name=Massimo /&gt;{{rp|66}}}}&lt;ref name=Massimo /&gt;{{rp|66}} Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.&lt;ref name=Cosmic /&gt;{{rp|83}}

[[Georges Charpak]] and Henri Broch dealt with claims from western astrology in the book ''Debunked! ESP, Telekinesis, and other Pseudoscience''.&lt;ref name=CharpakObit /&gt; They pointed out that astrologers have only a small knowledge of astronomy and that they often do not take into account basic features such as the [[Precession#Axial precession (precession of the equinoxes)|precession of the equinoxes]], which would change the position of the sun with time. They commented on the example of [[Elizabeth Teissier]] who claimed that "the sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year" as the basis for claims that two people with the same birthday but a number of years apart should be under the same planetary influence. Charpak and Broch noted that "there is a difference of about twenty-two thousand miles between Earth's location on any specific date in two successive years" and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology. Over a 40 years period there would be a difference greater than 780,000 miles.&lt;ref name=Charpak /&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

===Lack of physical basis===
Edward W. James, commented that attaching significance to the constellation on the celestial sphere the sun is in at sunset was done on the basis of human factors—namely, that astrologers didn't want to wake up early, and the exact time of noon was hard to know. Further, the creation of the zodiac and the disconnect from the constellations was because the sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time.&lt;ref name=EdwardJ /&gt;{{rp|25}} This disconnection from the constellations led to the problem with precession separating the zodiac symbols from the constellations that they once were related to.&lt;ref name=EdwardJ /&gt;{{rp|26}} Philosopher of science, [[Massimo Pigliucci]] commenting on the movement, opined "Well then, which sign should I look up when I open my Sunday paper, I wonder?"&lt;ref name=Massimo /&gt;{{rp|64}}

The tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated [[Astrological sign|sign]], astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations because they don't reference them.&lt;ref name=Charpak /&gt; Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being "...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars."&lt;ref name=Charpak/&gt; Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the [[Age of Aquarius]], which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt;

===Lack of predictive power===
[[File:Pluto and its satellites (2005) without labels.jpg|thumbnail|Shown in the image is Pluto and its satellites. Astrology was claimed to work before the discovery of Neptune, Uranus and Pluto and they have now been included in the discourse on an ''ad hoc'' basis.]]

Some astrologers make claims that the position of all the planets must be taken into account, but astrologers were unable to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on mistakes in horoscopes. Instead Neptune was predicted using [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].&lt;ref name=Cosmic/&gt; The grafting on of [[Uranus]], Neptune and [[Pluto]] into the astrology discourse was done on an ''[[ad hoc]]'' basis.&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt;

On the demotion of Pluto to the status of [[dwarf planet]], Philip Zarka of the [[Paris Observatory]] in [[Meudon]], France wondered how astrologers should respond:&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt;

{{quote|Should astrologers remove it from the list of luminars [Sun, Moon and the 8 planets other than earth] and confess that it did not actually bring any improvement? If they decide to keep it, what about the growing list of other recently discovered similar bodies (Sedna, Quaoar. etc), some of which even have satellites (Xena, 2003EL61)?}}

===Lack of mechanism===
Astrology has been criticised for failing to provide a [[Physical property|physical mechanism]] that links the movements of celestial bodies to their purported effects on human behaviour. In a lecture in 2001, [[Stephen Hawking]] stated "The reason most scientists don't believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."&lt;ref name=Hawking /&gt; In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, ''The Humanist'' magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by [[Bart J. Bok]], Lawrence E. Jerome, and [[Paul Kurtz]].&lt;ref name=Humanist /&gt; The statement, entitled 'Objections to Astrology', was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:
{{quote|We can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.&lt;ref name=Humanist /&gt;}}

Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while "certainly a relevant point") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of ''The Humanist'', Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.&lt;ref name=Humanist /&gt;

The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, "as above so below" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James' example of "Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war", is a [[false cause]] fallacy.&lt;ref name=EdwardJ /&gt;{{rp|26}}

Many astrologers claim that astrology is scientific.&lt;ref name=ChrisFrench /&gt; If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only [[four fundamental forces]] (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Massimo /&gt;{{rp|65}} Some astrologers have proposed conventional [[Causality|causal agent]]s such as [[electromagnetism]] and [[gravity]].&lt;ref name=ChrisFrench/&gt;&lt;ref name=SundayTimes /&gt; The strength of these forces drops off with distance.&lt;ref name=Massimo/&gt;{{rp|65}} Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible&lt;ref name=ChrisFrench /&gt; since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes /&gt; Astronomer [[Phil Plait]] noted that in terms of magnitude, the sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn't based just off the sun alone.&lt;ref name=Massimo/&gt;{{rp|65}}&lt;ref name=Plait&gt;{{cite web|last=Plait|first=Phil|title=Astrology|url=http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html|publisher=[[Bad Astronomy]]|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in [[physics]] with the unification of Electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an [[Marcello Truzzi#"Extraordinary claims"|extraordinary claim]].&lt;ref name=Massimo/&gt;{{rp|65}} It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.&lt;ref name=Massimo /&gt;{{rp|65}} If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.&lt;ref name=Massimo /&gt;{{rp|66}}

Carl Jung sought to invoke [[synchronicity]], the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable.&lt;ref name=Shermer /&gt; The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.{{efn|Jung made the claims, despite being aware that there was no statistical significance in the results. Looking for coincidences post hoc is of very dubious value, see [[Misuse of statistics#Data dredging|Data dredging]].&lt;ref name=Shermer /&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Samuels /&gt;

==Psychology==
{{see also|Forer effect}}
It has also been shown that [[confirmation bias]] is a [[Psychology|psychological]] factor that contributes to belief in astrology.&lt;ref name=Allum /&gt;{{rp|344}}&lt;ref name=Raymond/&gt;{{rp|180–181}}&lt;ref name=Eysenck1982 /&gt;{{rp|42–48}} Confirmation bias is a form of [[cognitive bias]].{{efn|see [[Heuristics in judgement and decision making]]}}&lt;ref name=Gonzalez /&gt;{{rp|553}}

From the literature, astrology believers often tend to selectively remember those predictions that turned out to be true and do not remember those that turned out false. Another, separate, form of confirmation bias also plays a role, where believers often fail to distinguish between messages that demonstrate special ability and those that do not.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt;{{rp|180–181}}

Thus there are two distinct forms of confirmation bias that are under study with respect to astrological belief.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt;{{rp|180–181}}

The [[Barnum effect]] is the tendency for an individual to give a high accuracy rating to a description of their personality that supposedly tailored specifically for them, but is, in fact, vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. If more information is requested for a prediction, the more accepting people are of the results.&lt;ref name=Allum /&gt;{{rp|344}}

In 1949 [[Bertram Forer]] conducted a personality test on students in his classroom.&lt;ref name=Allum /&gt;{{rp|344}} Each student was given a supposedly individual assessment but actually all students received the same assessment. The personality descriptions were taken from a book on astrology. When the students were asked to comment on the accuracy of the test, more than 40% gave it the top mark of 5 out of 5, and the average rating was 4.2.&lt;ref name=Paul /&gt;{{rp|134, 135}} The results of this study have been replicated in numerous other studies.&lt;ref name=Rogers /&gt;{{rp|382}}

The study of the Barnum/Forer effect has been focused mostly on the level of acceptance of fake horoscopes and fake astrological personality profiles.&lt;ref name=Rogers /&gt;{{rp|382}} Recipients of these personality assessments consistently fail to distinguish between common and uncommon personality descriptors.&lt;ref name=Rogers /&gt;{{rp|383}} In a study by Paul Rogers and Janice Soule (2009), which was consistent with previous research on the issue, it was found that those who believed in astrology are generally more susceptible to giving more credence to the Barnum profile than sceptics.&lt;ref name=Rogers /&gt;{{rp|393}}

By a process known as self-attribution, it has been shown in numerous studies that individuals with knowledge of astrology tend to describe their personalities in terms of traits compatible with their astrological signs. The effect is heightened when the individuals were aware that the personality description was being used to discuss astrology. Individuals who were not familiar with astrology had no such tendency.&lt;ref name=Wunder /&gt;

==Sociology==
In 1953, sociologist [[Theodor W. Adorno]] conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project that examined mass culture in capitalist society.&lt;ref name=Nederman /&gt;{{rp|326}} Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably led to statements that encouraged conformity—and that astrologers who went against conformity with statements that discouraged performance at work etc. risked losing their jobs.&lt;ref name=Nederman /&gt;{{rp|327}} Adorno concluded that astrology was a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where flattery and vague generalisations subtly led individuals to believe the author of the column addressed them directly.&lt;ref name=Adorno /&gt; Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase [[opium of the people]], by Karl Marx, by commenting, "Occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes."&lt;ref name=Nederman /&gt;{{rp|329}}

False balance is where a false, unaccepted or spurious viewpoint is included alongside a well reasoned one in media reports and TV appearances and as a result the false balance implies "there were two equal sides to a story when clearly there were not".&lt;ref name=BMJ /&gt; During ''[[Wonders of the Solar System]]'', a TV programme by the [[BBC]], the physicist [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] said: "Despite the fact that astrology is a load of rubbish, Jupiter can in fact have a profound influence on our planet. And it's through a force. . . gravity." This upset believers in astrology who complained that there was no astrologer to provide an alternative viewpoint. Following the complaints of astrology believers, Cox gave the following statement to the BBC: "I apologise to the astrology community for not making myself clear. I should have said that this new age drivel is undermining the very fabric of our civilisation."&lt;ref name=BMJ /&gt; In the programme ''[[Stargazing Live]]'', Cox further commented by saying: "in the interests of balance on the BBC, yes astrology is nonsense."&lt;ref name=MartinRobbins /&gt; In an editorial in the medical journal ''[[BMJ]]'', editor Trevor Jackson cited this incident showing where [[false balance]] could occur.&lt;ref name=BMJ /&gt;

Studies and polling has shown that the belief in astrology is higher in western countries than might otherwise be expected.&lt;ref name=Allum /&gt; In 2012, in polls 42% of Americans said they thought astrology was at least partially scientific.&lt;ref name=NSFIndicators /&gt;{{rp|7/25}} This belief decreased with education and education is highly correlated with levels of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name=Allum /&gt;{{rp|345}}

Some of the reported belief levels are due to a confusion of astrology with astronomy (the scientific study of celestial objects). The closeness of the two words varies depending on the language.&lt;ref name=Allum /&gt;{{rp|344, 346}} A plain description of astrology as an "occult influence of stars, planets etc. on human affairs" had no impact on the general public's assessment of whether astrology is scientific or not in a 1992 [[eurobarometer]] poll. This may partially be due to the implicit association amongst the general public, of any wording ending in "ology" with a legitimate field of knowledge.&lt;ref name=Allum /&gt;{{rp|346}} In Eurobarometers 224 and 225 performed in 2004, a split poll was used to isolate confusion over wording. In half of the polls, the word "astrology" was used, while in the other the word "horoscope" was used.&lt;ref name=Allum /&gt;{{rp|349}} Belief that astrology was at least partially scientific was 76%, but belief that horoscopes were at least partially scientific was 43%. In particular, belief that astrology was very scientific was 26% while that of horoscopes was 7%.&lt;ref name=Allum /&gt;{{rp|352}} This appeared to indicate that the high level of apparent polling support for astrology in the EU was indeed due to confusion over terminology.&lt;ref name=Allum /&gt;{{rp|362}}

Named after the 19th-century showman Phineas T. Barnum, whose circus act provided "a little something for everyone", it refers to the idea that people believe a statement about their personality that is vague or trivial if they think that it derives from some systematic procedure tailored especially for them (Dickson &amp; Kelly, 1985; Furnham &amp; Schofield, 1987; Rogers &amp; Soule, 2009; Wyman &amp; Vyse, 2008). For example, the more birth detail is used in an astrological prediction or horoscope, the more credulous people tend to be (Furnham, 1991). However, confirmation bias means that people do not tend to pay attention to other information that might disconfirm the credibility of the predictions.|citeseerx=10.1.1.598.6954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first Barnum study, Forer (1949) administered, astrological believers deemed a Barnum profile supposedly derived from astrology was a better description of their own personality than did astrological skeptics.

The '''''Huihui Lifa''''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 回回歷法; [[Simplified Chinese]]: 回回历法; [[pinyin]]: Huíhuí Lìfǎ) was a set of astronomical tables published throughout China from the time of the [[Ming Dynasty]] in the late 14th century through the early 18th century. The tables were based on a translation into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] of the ''[[Zij]]'' (Islamic astronomical tables), the title ''Huihui Lifa'' literally meaning "Muslim System of Calendar Astronomy".

==History==
Around 1384, during the [[Ming Dynasty]], [[Hongwu Emperor]] ordered the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] translation and compilation of [[Zij|Islamic astronomical tables]], a task that was carried out by the scholars [[Mashayihei]], a Muslim astronomer, and [[Wu Bozong]], a Chinese scholar-official.

These tables came to be known as the ''Huihui Lifa'' (''Muslim System of Calendrical Astronomy''), and were published in China a number of times until the early 18th century,&lt;ref name=Yunli&gt;{{citation|title=The Korean Adaptation of the Chinese-Islamic Astronomical Tables|author=Yunli Shi|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|issn=1432-0657|volume=57|issue=1|date=January 2003|doi=10.1007/s00407-002-0060-z|pages=25–60 [26]}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact the [[Qing Dynasty]] had officially abandoned the tradition of Chinese-Islamic astronomy in 1659.&lt;ref name=Yunli/&gt;

[[File:Korean celestial globe.jpg|thumb|Korean celestial globe based on the ''Huihui Lifa''.]]

In the early [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] period, the [[Islamic calendar]] served as a basis for calendar reform owing to its superior accuracy over the existing Chinese-based calendars.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker |first=Don |title=Islam Struggles for a Toehold in Korea |journal=Harvard Asia Quarterly |date=Winter 2006 |url=http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/167/ |accessdate=2007-04-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517214927/http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/167/ |archivedate=2007-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Korean translation of the ''Huihui Lifa'' was studied in [[Korea]] under the [[Joseon Dynasty]] during the time of [[Sejong the Great|Sejong]] in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=Yunli/&gt; The tradition of Chinese-Islamic astronomy survived in Korea until the early 19th century.&lt;ref name=Yunli/&gt;

A '''proplyd''', a [[syllabic abbreviation]] of an '''ionized [[protoplanetary disk]]''', is an externally illuminated [[Photoevaporation|photoevaporating]] [[protoplanetary disk|disk]] around a [[Young stellar object|young star]]. Nearly 180 proplyds have been discovered in the [[Orion Nebula]].&lt;ref name= ricci08  /&gt; Images of proplyds in other [[star-forming region]]s are rare, while Orion is the only region with a large known sample due to its relative proximity to [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=esa09 /&gt;

== History ==
In 1979 observations with the [[André Lallemand|Lallemand electronic camera]] at the [[Pic du Midi Observatory|Pic-du-Midi Observatory]] showed six unresolved high-ionization sources near the [[Trapezium Cluster]]. These sources were not interpreted as proplyds, but as partly ionized globules (PIGs). The idea was that these objects are being ionized from the outside by [[Orion Nebula|M42]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laques|first=P.|last2=Vidal|first2=J.

Here the idea appeared that these objects might be low-mass stars surrounded by an evaporating protostellar accretion disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Churchwell|first=E.|last2=Felli|first2=M.|last3=Wood|first3=D.

Proplyds were clearly resolved in 1993 using images of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] Wide Field Camera and the term "proplyd" was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'dell|first=C. R.|last2=Wen|first2=Zheng|last3=Hu|first3=Xihai|date=June 1993|title=Discovery of New Objects in the Orion Nebula on HST Images: Shocks, Compact Sources, and Protoplanetary Disks|journal=ApJ|language=en|volume=410|pages=696|doi=10.1086/172786|bibcode=1993ApJ...410..696O|issn=0004-637X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
In the Orion Nebula the proplyds observed are usually one of two types. Some proplyds [[Photoionization|glow]] around [[Luminosity|luminous]] stars, in cases where the disk is found close to the star, glowing from the star's luminosity. Other proplyds are found at a greater distance from the host star and instead show up as dark silhouettes due to the self-obscuration of cooler dust and gases from the disk itself. Some proplyds show signs of movement from [[solar irradiance]] shock waves pushing the proplyds. The Orion Nebula is approximately 1,500 [[light-years]] from the [[Sun]] with very active [[star formation]]. The Orion Nebula and the Sun are in the same [[Orion Arm|spiral arm]] of the [[Milky way Galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic0917/ Space Telescope, Born in beauty: proplyds in the Orion Nebula, 14 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo9424b/ Space Telescope, Proplyds]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |date=22 December 2009 |title=Planetary Systems Now Forming in Orion |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |date=7 December 1996 |title=Planetary Systems Now Forming in Orion |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proplyd may form new [[planet]]s and [[planetesimal]] systems. Current models show that the [[metallicity]] of the star and proplyd, along with the correct planetary system temperature and distance from the star, are keys to planet and [[Nebular hypothesis|planetesimal formation]]. To date, the [[solar system]], with 8 planets, 5 [[dwarf planet]]s and 5 planetesimal systems, is the largest [[planetary system]] found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windows2universe.org/our_solar_system/solar_system.html Windows 2 Universe, Solar System]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/15451/the-solar-system/ universetoday.com, Solar System, by Matt Williams, 25 June 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/33059/inner-planets/ universetoday.com, Inner Planets of Our Solar System, by Matt Williams, 25 June 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Most proplyds develop into a system with no planetesimal systems, or into one very large planetesimal system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~jwang/Project4.html Caltech, Planet-Metallicity Correlation - The Rich Get Richer, by Ji Wang, Planet-Metallicity Correlation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...622.1102F The Planet-Metallicity Correlation. 2005, April 200, by Debra A.

[[File:Devastated Stellar Neighborhood.jpg|thumb|Dusty proplyds pointing to [[HD 17505]] in [[Westerhout 5]] as seen by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]]]
Photoevaporating proplyds in other star forming regions were found with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. [[NGC 1977]] currently represents the star-forming region with the largest number of proplyds outside of the Orion Nebula, with 7 proplyds.

The proplyds in the Orion Nebula and other star-forming regions represent proto-planetary disks around [[low-mass stars]] being externally photoevaporated. These low-mass proplyds are usually found within 0.3 [[parsec]] (60,000 [[astronomical unit]]s) of the massive OB star and the dusty proplyds have tails with a length of 0.1 to 0.2 parsec (20,000 to 40,000 au).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a proposed type of intermediate massive counterpart, called [[proplyd-like objects]]. Objects in [[NGC 3603]] and later in [[Cygnus OB2]] were proposed as intermediate massive versions of the bright proplyds found in the Orion Nebula. The proplyd-like objects in Cygnus OB2 for example are 6 to 14 parsec distant to a large collection of [[OB star]]s and have tail lengths of 0.11 to 0.55 parsec (24,000 to 113,000 au).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Nicholas J.|last2=Drake|first2=Jeremy J.|last3=Drew|first3=Janet E.|last4=Guarcello|first4=Mario G.|last5=Gutermuth|first5=Robert A.|last6=Hora|first6=Joseph L.|last7=Kraemer|first7=Kathleen E.|title=Photoevaporating Proplyd-Like Objects in Cygnus Ob2|date=February 2012|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=746|issue=2|pages=L21|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/746/2/L21|issn=2041-8205|arxiv=1201.2404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandner|first=Wolfgang|last2=Grebel|first2=Eva K.|last3=Chu|first3=You-Hua|last4=Dottori|first4=Horacio|last5=Brandl|first5=Bernhard|last6=Richling|first6=Sabine|last7=Yorke|first7=Harold W.|last8=Points|first8=Sean D.|last9=Zinnecker|first9=Hans|date=January 2000|title=HST/WFPC2 and VLT/ISAAC Observations of Proplyds in the Giant H II Region NGC 3603*|journal=The Astronomical Journal|language=en|volume=119|issue=1|pages=292|doi=10.1086/301192|issn=1538-3881}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of proplyd-like objects as intermediate massive proplyds is partly supported by a sperctrum for one object, which showed that the mass loss rate is higher than the mass accretion rate.

{{Infobox astronomical survey}}
The '''SLUGGS''' ('''SAGES Legacy Unifying Globulars and GalaxieS''') survey is an [[astronomical survey]] of 25 (and 3 `bonus') nearby [[Early-type galaxies|early-type]] ([[Elliptical galaxy|E]] and [[Lenticular galaxy|S0]]) galaxies. This survey uses a combination of imaging from [[Subaru Telescope|Subaru]]/Suprime-Cam and spectroscopy from [[Keck telescope|Keck]]/DEIMOS to investigate the chemo-dynamical properties of both the diffuse starlight and the [[globular cluster]] systems of the target galaxies.
Pilot data for the survey was obtained in 2006 and data acquisition was completed in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=SLUGGS survey|title=SLUGGS Survey|url=http://sluggs.swin.edu.au/Survey.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SLUGGS project was so named in honor of the [[banana slug]] mascot of the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].

==SAGES==
SAGES (Study of the Astrophysics of Globular Clusters in Extragalactic Systems) is an international network of researchers investigating the formation and evolution of globular clusters and their host galaxies, using observational facilities around the world, particularly the Keck and Subaru telescopes. &lt;ref name="sages"&gt;{{cite web |title=Home page |url=http://sages.ucolick.org/ |publisher=SAGES |accessdate=1 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by 
Jean Brodie, Duncan Forbes, Aaron Romanowsky and Jay Strader. 

==Method==
Deep wide-field imaging from Subaru/Suprime-Cam is used to identify and measure the positions of candidate globular clusters around each survey galaxy. Several (up to 6) DEIMOS masks are then created which include slits corresponding to the locations of globular clusters, galaxy starlight and random background sky locations in the outer parts of the mask. 
The DEIMOS spectrograph, on the Keck telescope, is centred on wavelengths around the [[Calcium triplet|Calcium Triplet lines]] (~850&amp;nbsp;nm). After a typical 2 hour exposure per mask, spectra of globular clusters and galaxy starlight is obtained.  
Using a technique called SKiMS (Stellar Kinematics from Multiple Slits) it is possible to extract the kinematics (and metallicity) of galaxy starlight out to 3 [[Effective radius|effective radii]]. Equivalent data for the globular clusters is obtained out to ~10 effective radii. The DEIMOS instrument has the advantages of being a stable, high throughput, wide-field spectrograph coupled with excellent velocity resolution (~12&amp;nbsp;km/s) on a 10m telescope. This technique effectively uses DEIMOS as a pseudo wide area [[integral field unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Arnold|first1 = Jacob A.|last2 = Romanowsky|first2 = Aaron J.|last3 = Brodie|first3 = Jean P.|last4 = Forbes|first4 = Duncan A.|last5 = Strader|first5 = Jay|last6 = Spitler|first6 = Lee R.|last7 = Foster|first7 = Caroline|last8 = Blom|first8 = Christina|last9 = Kartha|first9 = Sreeja S.|last10 = Pastorello|first10 = Nicola|last11 = Pota|first11 = Vincenzo|last12 = Usher|first12 = Christopher|last13 = Woodley|first13 = Kristin A.|title = The Sluggs Survey: Wide-Field Stellar Kinematics of Early-Type Galaxies|journal = The Astrophysical Journal|date = 30 July 2014|volume = 791|issue = 2|pages = 80|doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/791/2/80|arxiv = 1310.2607|bibcode = 2014ApJ...791...80A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survey selection==
The 25 target galaxies are chosen to be representative (i.e. cover the range of basic galaxy parameters and environments) of nearby (distance &lt; 27 Mpc) early type (E and S0) galaxies. The survey also includes 3 `bonus’ galaxies which have been observed during times that the main sample galaxies are not available. All galaxies are accessible from the northern hemisphere. Although only a small sample, the data reach to large galactocentric radii with excellent velocity resolution and [[Signal-to-noise ratio|S/N]] compared to other surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodie|first1=Jean P.|last2=Romanowsky|first2=Aaron J.|last3=Strader|first3=Jay|last4=Forbes|first4=Duncan A.|last5=Foster|first5=Caroline|last6=Jennings|first6=Zachary G.|last7=Pastorello|first7=Nicola|last8=Pota|first8=Vincenzo|last9=Usher|first9=Christopher|last10=Blom|first10=Christina|last11=Kader|first11=Justin|last12=Roediger|first12=Joel C.|last13=Spitler|first13=Lee R.|last14=Villaume|first14=Alexa|last15=Arnold|first15=Jacob A.|last16=Kartha|first16=Sreeja S.|last17=Woodley|first17=Kristin A.|title=The Sages Legacy Unifying Globulars and Galaxies Survey (Sluggs): Sample Definition, Methods, and Initial Results|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=5 November 2014|volume=796|issue=1|pages=52|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/796/1/52|arxiv=1405.2079|bibcode=2014ApJ...796...52B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astronomy]], a '''celestial coordinate system''' (or '''celestial reference system''') is a system for specifying positions of [[Natural satellite|satellites]], [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, [[Galaxy|galaxies]], and other celestial objects  relative to physical reference points available to a situated observer (e.g. the true [[horizon]] and north [[cardinal direction]] to an observer situated on the Earth's surface). [[Coordinate system]]s can specify an object's position in [[three-dimensional space]] or [[plot (graphics)|plot]] merely its direction on a [[celestial sphere]], if the object's distance is unknown or trivial.

The coordinate systems are implemented in either [[spherical coordinate system|spherical]] or [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular coordinates]]. Spherical coordinates, projected on the [[celestial sphere]], are analogous to the [[geographic coordinate system]] used on the surface of [[Earth]]. These differ in their choice of [[fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]], which divides the celestial sphere into two equal [[sphere|hemisphere]]s along a [[great circle]]. Rectangular coordinates, in appropriate [[Units of measurement|units]], are simply the cartesian equivalent of the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]], with the same fundamental ({{math|''x, y''}}) plane and [[Primary direction|primary ({{math|''x''}}-axis) direction]]. Each coordinate system is named after its choice of fundamental plane.

== Coordinate systems ==
The following table lists the common coordinate systems in use by the astronomical community. The [[Fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]] divides the [[celestial sphere]] into two equal [[Celestial sphere|hemispheres]] and defines the baseline for the latitudinal coordinates, similar to the [[equator]] in the [[geographic coordinate system]]. The poles are located at ±90° from the fundamental plane. The primary direction is the starting point of the longitudinal coordinates. The origin is the zero distance point, the "center of the celestial sphere", although the definition of [[celestial sphere]] is ambiguous about the definition of its center point.

===Horizontal system===
{{Main|Horizontal coordinate system}}
The ''horizontal'', or [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude-azimuth]], system is based on the position of the observer on Earth, which revolves around its own axis once per [[sidereal day]] (23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.091 seconds) in relation to the star background. The positioning of a celestial object by the horizontal system varies with time, but is a useful coordinate system for locating and tracking objects for observers on Earth.  It is based on the position of stars relative to an observer's ideal horizon.

===Equatorial system===
{{Main|Equatorial coordinate system}}
The ''equatorial'' coordinate system is centered at Earth's center, but fixed relative to the celestial poles and the [[Equinox (celestial coordinates)|March equinox]]. The coordinates are based on the location of stars relative to Earth's equator if it were projected out to an infinite distance.  The equatorial describes the sky as seen from the [[Solar System]], and modern star maps almost exclusively use equatorial coordinates.

The ''equatorial'' system is the normal coordinate system for most professional and many amateur astronomers having an equatorial mount that follows the movement of the sky during the night. Celestial objects are found by adjusting the telescope's or other instrument's scales so that they match the equatorial coordinates of the selected object to observe.

Popular choices of pole and equator are the older [[B1950]] and the modern [[J2000]] systems, but a pole and equator "of date" can also be used, meaning one appropriate to the date under consideration, such as when a measurement of the position of a planet or spacecraft is made. There are also subdivisions into "mean of date" coordinates, which average out or ignore [[astronomical nutation|nutation]], and "true of date," which include nutation.

===Ecliptic system===
{{Main|Ecliptic coordinate system}}
The fundamental plane is the plane of the Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic plane.  There are two principal variants of the ecliptic coordinate system: geocentric ecliptic coordinates centered on the Earth and heliocentric ecliptic coordinates centered on the center of mass of the Solar System.

The geocentric ecliptic system was the principal coordinate system for ancient astronomy and is still useful for computing the apparent motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asger Aaboe|Aaboe, Asger]]. 2001 ''Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy.'' New York: Springer-Verlag., pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The heliocentric ecliptic system describes the planets' orbital movement around the Sun, and centers on the [[Center of mass#Barycenter in astrophysics and astronomy|barycenter]] of the Solar System (i.e. very close to the center of the Sun). The system is primarily used for computing the positions of planets and other Solar System bodies, as well as defining their [[orbital elements]].

===Galactic system===
{{Main|Galactic coordinate system}}
The galactic coordinate system uses the approximate plane of our galaxy as its fundamental plane.  The Solar System is still the center of the coordinate system, and the zero point is defined as the direction towards the galactic center. Galactic latitude resembles the elevation above the galactic plane and galactic longitude determines direction relative to the center of the galaxy.

===Supergalactic system===
{{Main|Supergalactic coordinate system}}
The supergalactic coordinate system corresponds to a fundamental plane that contains a higher than average number of local galaxies in the sky as seen from Earth.

  \tan\left(A\right) &amp;= {\sin\left(h\right) \over \cos\left(h\right) \sin\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) - \tan\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(\phi_\text{o}\right)}; \qquad \begin{cases}
    \cos\left(a\right) \sin\left(A\right) = \cos\left(\delta\right) \sin\left(h\right) ;\\
    \cos\left(a\right) \cos\left(A\right) = \cos\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(h\right) \sin\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) - \sin\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(\phi_\text{o}\right)
  \end{cases} \\[3pt]
  \sin\left(a\right) &amp;= \sin\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) \sin\left(\delta\right) + \cos\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) \cos\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(h\right);
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In solving the {{math|tan(''A'')}} equation for {{math|''A''}}, in order to avoid the ambiguity of the [[arctangent]], use of the [[atan2|two-argument arctangent]], denoted {{math|arctan(''x'',''y'')}}, is recommended. The two-argument arctangent computes the arctangent of {{math|{{sfrac|''y''|''x''}}}}, and accounts for the quadrant in which it is being computed. Thus, consistent with the convention of azimuth being measured from the south and opening positive to the west,
:&lt;math&gt;A = -\arctan(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;,

where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= -\sin\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) \cos\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(h\right) + \cos\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) \sin\left(\delta\right) \\
  y &amp;=  \cos\left(\delta\right) \sin\left(h\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the above formula produces a negative value for {{math|''A''}}, it can be rendered positive by simply adding 360°.

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Depending on the azimuth convention in use, the signs of {{math|cos ''A''}} and {{math|sin ''A''}} appear in all four different combinations. Karttunen et al., Taff and Roth define {{math|''A''}} clockwise from the south. Lang defines it north through east, Smart north through west. Meeus (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;89: {{math|sin ''δ'' {{=}} sin ''φ'' sin ''a'' − cos ''φ'' cos ''a'' cos ''A''}}; ''Explanatory Supplement'' (1961), p.&amp;nbsp;26: {{math|sin ''δ'' {{=}} sin ''a'' sin ''φ'' + cos ''a'' cos ''A'' cos ''φ''}}. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, in solving the {{math|tan(''h'')}} equation for {{math|''h''}}, use of the two-argument arctangent that accounts for the quadrant is recommended. Thus, again consistent with the convention of azimuth being measured from the south and opening positive to the west,
: &lt;math&gt;h = \arctan(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;,

where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
              x &amp;= \sin\left(\phi_\text{o}\right)\cos\left(a\right) \cos\left(A\right) + \cos\left(\phi_\text{o}\right)\sin\left(a\right) \\

=== Equatorial ↔ galactic ===
These equations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|title=Transformation of the equatorial proper motion to the Galactic system|last=Poleski|first=Radosław|year=2013|class=astro-ph.IM|eprint=1306.2945}}&lt;/ref&gt; are for converting equatorial coordinates to Galactic coordinates.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \cos\left(l_\text{NCP} - l\right)\cos(b) &amp;= \sin\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(\delta_\text{G}\right) - \cos\left(\delta\right)\sin\left(\delta_\text{G}\right)\cos\left(\alpha - \alpha_\text{G}\right) \\
  \sin\left(l_\text{NCP} - l\right)\cos(b) &amp;= \cos(\delta)\sin\left(\alpha - \alpha_\text{G}\right) \\
                        \sin\left(b\right) &amp;= \sin\left(\delta\right) \sin\left(\delta_\text{G}\right) + \cos\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(\delta_\text{G}\right) \cos\left(\alpha - \alpha_\text{G}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_\text{G}, \delta_\text{G}&lt;/math&gt; are the equatorial coordinates of the North Galactic Pole and &lt;math&gt;l_\text{NCP}&lt;/math&gt; is the Galactic longitude of the North Celestial Pole. Referred to [[Epoch (astronomy)|J2000.0]] the values of these quantities are:
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_G = 192.85948^\circ \qquad \delta_G = 27.12825^\circ \qquad l_\text{NCP}=122.93192^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

If the equatorial coordinates are referred to another [[Equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]], they must be [[Axial precession|precessed]] to their place at J2000.0 before applying these formulae.

These equations convert to equatorial coordinates referred to [[Epoch (astronomy)|B2000.0]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sin\left(\alpha - \alpha_\text{G}\right)\cos\left(\delta\right) &amp;= \cos\left(b\right) \sin\left(l_\text{NCP} - l\right) \\
  \cos\left(\alpha - \alpha_\text{G}\right)\cos\left(\delta\right) &amp;= \sin\left(b\right) \cos\left(\delta_\text{G}\right) - \cos\left(b\right) \sin\left(\delta_\text{G}\right)\cos\left(l_\text{NCP} - l\right) \\
                                      \sin\left(\delta\right) &amp;= \sin\left(b\right) \sin\left(\delta_\text{G}\right) + \cos\left(b\right) \cos\left(\delta_\text{G}\right) \cos\left(l_\text{NCP} - l\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Notes on conversion ===

* Angles in the degrees ( ° ), minutes ( ′ ), and seconds ( ″ ) of [[Minute of arc|sexagesimal measure]] must be converted to decimal before calculations are performed. Whether they are converted to decimal [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] or [[radian]]s depends upon the particular calculating machine or program. Negative angles must be carefully handled; {{nowrap|–10° 20′ 30″}} must be converted as {{nowrap|−10° −20′ −30″}}.
* Angles in the hours ( &lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; ), minutes ( &lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; ), and seconds ( &lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; ) of time measure must be converted to decimal [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] or [[radian]]s before calculations are performed. 1&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15°; 1&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15′; 1&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15″
* Angles greater than 360° (2{{pi}}) or less than 0° may need to be reduced to the range 0°−360° (0–2{{pi}}) depending upon the particular calculating machine or program.
* The cosine of a latitude (declination, ecliptic and Galactic latitude, and altitude) are always positive by definition, since the latitude varies between −90° and +90°.
* [[Inverse trigonometric functions]] arcsine, arccosine and arctangent are [[quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]]-ambiguous, and results should be carefully evaluated. Use of  the [[Atan2|second arctangent function]] (denoted in computing as &lt;tt&gt;atn2(''y'',''x'')&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;atan2(''y'',''x'')&lt;/tt&gt;, which calculates the arctangent of {{math|{{sfrac|''y''|''x''}}}} using the sign of both arguments to determine the right quadrant) is recommended when calculating longitude/right ascension/azimuth. An equation which finds the [[Trigonometric functions|sine]], followed by the [[Inverse trigonometric functions|arcsin function]], is recommended when calculating latitude/declination/altitude.
* Azimuth ({{math|''A''}}) is referred here to the south point of the [[horizon]], the common astronomical reckoning. An object on the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] to the south of the observer has {{math|''A''}} = {{math|''h''}} = 0° with this usage. However, n [[Astropy]]'s AltAz, in the [[Large Binocular Telescope]] FITS file convention, and in [[XEphem]] for example, the azimuth is East of North.  In [[navigation]] and some other disciplines, azimuth is figured from the north.
* The equations for altitude ({{math|''a''}}) do not account for [[atmospheric refraction]].
* The equations for horizontal coordinates do not account for [[diurnal parallax]], that is, the small offset in the position of a celestial object caused by the position of the observer on the [[Earth]]'s surface. This effect is significant for the [[Moon]], less so for the [[planet]]s, minute for [[star]]s or more distant objects.
* Observer's longitude ({{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}}) here is measured positively westward from the [[prime meridian]]; this is contrary to current [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] standards.

== Introduction ==
Astrophysical fluid dynamics deals with the application of fluid dynamics and its equations in the movement of the fluids in space. The applications are entirely different from what we usually study as all of this happens in vacuum with zero gravity.

Most of the Interstellar Medium is not at rest, but is in supersonic motion under the action of supernova explosions, stellar winds and radiation fields and the time dependent gravitational field due to spiral density waves in the stellar disc of the galaxy. Since supersonic motions almost always involve shock waves, these play a crucial role. The galaxy also contains a dynamically significant magnetic field which means that the dynamics is governed by the equations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics.

In many cases the electrical conductivity is large enough for the ideal magnetohydrodynamics to be a good approximation, but this is not true in star forming regions where the gas density is high and the degree of ionization is low.

One of the most interesting problems is that of star formation. It is known that stars form out of the Interstellar Medium and that this mostly occurs in Giant Molecular Clouds such as the Rosette Nebula for example. It has been known for a long time that an interstellar cloud can collapse due to its self-gravity if it is large enough, but in the ordinary interstellar medium, this can only happen if the cloud has a mass of several thousand solar masses - much larger than that of any star. There must therefore be some process that fragments the cloud into smaller high density clouds whose masses are in the same range as that of stars. Self-gravity cannot do this, but it turns out that there are processes that do this if the magnetic pressure is much larger than the thermal pressure, as it is in Giant Molecular Clouds. These processes rely on the interaction of magnetohydrodynamic waves with a thermal instability. A magnetohydrodynamic wave in a medium in which the magnetic pressure is much larger than the thermal pressure can produce dense regions, but they cannot by themselves make the density high enough for self-gravity to act. However, the gas in star forming regions is heated by cosmic rays and is cooled by radiative processes. The net result is that gas in a thermal equilibrium state in which heating balances cooling can exist in three different phases at the same pressure: a warm phase with a low density, an unstable phase with intermediate density and a cold phase at low temperature. An increase in pressure, due to a supernova or a spiral density wave can flip the gas from the warm phase into the unstable phase and a Magnetohydrodynamic wave can then produce dense fragments in the cold phase whose self-gravity is strong enough for them to collapse to form stars .

In this process, we can study the dynamics of the cosmic gas and understand the formation of stars. This is just one example. Even Magnetohydrodynamics has its basis on the fundamentals of astrophysical fluid dynamics.

== Basic concepts ==

=== Concepts of Fluid Dynamics ===
The equations of Fluid Dynamics are tools in developing an understanding of the phenomena in Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics. The important equations with their applications are as mentioned below.

'''Conservation of Mass'''

The continuity equation applies the principle of conservation of mass to fluid flow. Consider a fluid flowing through a fixed volume tank having one inlet and one outlet as shown below.

If the flow is steady i.e. no accumulation of fluid within the tank, then the rate of fluid flow at entry must be equal to the rate of fluid flow at exit for mass conservation. If, at entry (or exit) having a cross-sectional area A (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), a fluid parcel travels a distance dL in time dt, then the volume flow rate (V, m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s) is given by: ''V = (A . dL)/∆t''

but since dL/∆t is the fluid velocity (v, m/s) we can write:             ''Q = V x A''

The mass flow rate (m, kg/s) is given by the product of density and volume flow rate

''i.e   m = ρ.Q = ρ .V.A''

Between two points in flowing fluid for mass conservation we can write: m1=m2

  ''Or   ρ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''= ρ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

If the fluid is '''''incompressible''''' i.e. ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; then:

''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''= V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

But, We shall apply this theorem for Astrophysicsical Fluid Dynamics in supersonic Flow regime which will require us to consider a Compressible flow condition where density is not constant.

An application for fluid dynamics in astrophysics is the Neutron stars, which are ancient remnants of stars that have reached the end of their evolutionary journey through space and time.

These interesting objects are born from once-large stars that grew to four to eight times the size of our own sun before exploding in catastrophic supernovae. After such an explosion blows a star's outer layers into space, the core remains—but it no longer produces nuclear fusion. With no outward pressure from fusion to counterbalance gravity's inward pull, the star condenses and collapses in upon itself.

Despite their small diameters—about 12.5 miles (20 kilometers)—neutron stars boast nearly 1.5 times the mass of our sun, and are thus incredibly dense. Just a sugar cube of neutron star matter would weigh about one hundred million tons on Earth.

A neutron star's almost incomprehensible density causes protons and electrons to combine into neutrons—the process that gives such stars their name. The composition of their cores is unknown, but they may consist of a neutron superfluid or some unknown state of matter.

Neutron stars pack an extremely strong gravitational pull, much greater than Earth's. This gravitational strength is particularly impressive because of the stars' small size.

When they are formed, neutron stars rotate in space. As they compress and shrink, this spinning speeds up because of the conservation of angular momentum—the same principle that causes a spinning skater to speed up when she pulls in her arms.

These stars gradually slow down over the eons, but those bodies that are still spinning rapidly may emit radiation that from Earth appears to blink on and off as the star spins, like the beam of light from a turning lighthouse. This "pulsing" appearance gives some neutron stars the name pulsars.

After spinning for several million years pulsars are drained of their energy and become normal neutron stars. Few of the known existing neutron stars are pulsars. Only about 1,000 pulsars are known to exist, though there may be hundreds of millions of old neutron stars in the galaxy.

The staggering pressures that exist at the core of neutron stars may be like those that existed at the time of the big bang, but these states cannot be simulated on Earth.

'''The astrolabe of Barcelona''' is considered the most ancient [[astrolabe]] with Carolingian characters that has survived in the Christian Occident.
The French researcher Marcel Destombes founded the astrolabe, and left it as legacy to the [[Arab World Institute|Institute of the Arab World]] of Paris in 1983.

The Academy of Sciences of Barcelona asked the astrolabe in loan to the Musée of l'Institut du Monde Arabe, to make a replica, today this replica is on display at the Academy of Sciences in the Ramblas.

== Description ==
This astrolabe presents some unusual characteristics. All the engraved characters are in Latin, this fact made the scholars think that the instrument was made in the Christian Europe. The pointers of his "spider" indicate eighteen stars: ten boreal stars  and eight austral stars (that is to say, situated beneath of the equator). Eleven of them correspond to the date of 980 AD. Still like this, the names of the stars are not engraved on the brass. The words ROME and FRANCE are engraved in Latin characters in one of the eardrums. These characters are accompanied by the numbers 41-30 (in Arabic figures).&lt;ref name="Destomb"&gt;Un astrolabe carolingien et l'origine de nos chiffres arabes; Marcel Destombes; Paris, Peyronnet, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; The characters are identical to those used at the end of the 10th century in the Catalan Latin manuscripts, being Catalonia in that moment a mark of the Carolingian France. This would explain the presence of the word FRANCE. The figures express in degrees and minutes: 41° 30′, which correspond exactly to the latitude of Barcelona.

The fact of having engraved the date 980 AD. and the latitude of Barcelona (41–30), which  archdeacon in those dates was [[Lupitus of Barcelona|Sunifred Llobet]], to whom is attributed the authorship of the Ripoll's manuscript: ms.225,  which contains the description of an astrolabe, has led the scholars to attribute the paternity of the astrolabe to this famous astronomer, also known with the name of [[Lupitus Barchinonensis]]&lt;ref name="Destomb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;Assaig d'història de les idees físiques i matemàtiques a la Catalunya medieval / J. Millás Vallicrosa; pròleg : Joan Vernet.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advanced Scientific Data Format''' ('''ASDF''') is a proposed replacement to the [[FITS]] standard for astronomical images and other astronomical data.&lt;ref name=Greenfield2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenfield |first1=P. |last2=Droettboom |first2=M. |last3=Bray |first3=E. |year=2015 |title=ASDF: A new data format for astronomy |journal=Astronomy and Computing |volume=12 |pages=240–251 |doi=10.1016/j.ascom.2015.06.004 |bibcode = 2015A&amp;C....12..240G|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[metadata]] is contained in a [[YAML]] header followed by binary or ASCII data.

==Improvements to FITS==
The Flexible Image Transport System [[FITS]] standard is a widely used data format in astronomy that incorporates metadata and ascii or binary data in the same file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wells |first1=D. C. |last2=Greisen |first2=E. W. |last3=Harten |first3=R.

For example, the FITS 'cards' have keywords limited to only 8 characters, which can make it difficult to properly describe the value associated with it and the value for each keyword and its comment cannot be longer than 68 characters.&lt;ref name=Greenfield2015 /&gt; By using [[YAML]], more sophisticated and nested data structures may be used in ASDF than FITS.

'''Astroinformatics''' is an interdisciplinary field of study involving the combination of [[astronomy]], [[data science]], [[machine learning]], [[informatics]], and [[Information technology|information]]/[[Communications technologies|communications]] technologies.&lt;ref name="astroinfo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;[http://www.math.bas.bg/~nkirov/zip/SEEDI_astro_presentation.pdf Astroinformatics and digitization of astronomical heritage], Nikolay Kirov. The fifth SEEDI International Conference Digitization of cultural and scientific heritage, May 19–20, 2010, Sarajevo. Retrieved 1 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Astroinformatics is primarily focused on developing the tools, methods, and applications of [[computational science]], [[data science]], [[machine learning]], and [[statistics]] for research and education in data-oriented astronomy.&lt;ref name="astroinfo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borne |first1=Kirk D. |title=Astroinformatics: data-oriented astronomy research and education |journal=Earth Science Informatics |date=12 May 2010 |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=5–17 |doi=10.1007/s12145-010-0055-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early efforts in this direction included [[data exploration|data discovery]], [[metadata standards]] development, [[data modeling]], astronomical [[data dictionary]] development, [[data access]], [[information retrieval]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Science User Scenarios for a Virtual Observatory Design Reference Mission: Science Requirements for Data Mining|eprint=astro-ph/0008307|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[data integration]], and [[data mining]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Kargupta |editor-first1=Hillol |display-editors=etal |title=Next generation of data mining |date=2008 |location=London |isbn=9781420085860 |last1=Borne |first1=Kirk|chapter=Scientific Data Mining in Astronomy |publisher=CRC Press |pages=91–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the astronomical [[Virtual Observatory]] initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1117/12.487536|chapter=Distributed data mining in the National Virtual Observatory|title=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory, Tools, and Technology V|volume=5098|pages=211–218|series=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory, Tools, and Technology V|year=2003|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk D|editor1-first=Belur V|editor1-last=Dasarathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VOdm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurino |first1=O. |last2=D’Abrusco |first2=R. |last3=Longo |first3=G. |last4=Riccio |first4=G. |title=Astroinformatics of galaxies and quasars: a new general method for photometric redshifts estimation |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |date=21 December 2011 |volume=418 |issue=4 |pages=2165–2195 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19416.x|arxiv=1107.3160 |bibcode=2011MNRAS.418.2165L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further development of the field, along with astronomy community endorsement, was presented to the [[National Research Council (United States)]] in 2009 in the Astroinformatics "State of the Profession" Position Paper for the 2010 [[Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics: A 21st Century Approach to Astronomy|journal=Astro2010: The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey|arxiv = 0909.3892 |year=2009|volume=2010|pages=P6|bibcode=2009astro2010P...6B}}&lt;/ref&gt; That position paper provided the basis for the subsequent more detailed exposition of the field in the Informatics Journal paper ''Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy Research and Education''.&lt;ref name="astroinfo" /&gt;

Astroinformatics as a distinct field of research was inspired by work in the fields of [[Bioinformatics]] and [[Geoinformatics]], and through the [[eScience]] work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Science|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gray/JimGrayTalks.htm|website=Talks by Jim Gray|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)]] at [[Microsoft Research]], whose legacy was remembered and continued through the Jim Gray eScience Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Gray eScience Award|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/focus/escience/jim-gray-award.aspx|website=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the primary focus of Astroinformatics is on the large worldwide distributed collection of digital astronomical databases, image archives, and research tools, the field recognizes the importance of legacy data sets as well—using modern technologies to preserve and analyze historical astronomical observations. Some Astroinformatics practitioners help to [[Digital data|digitize]] historical and recent astronomical observations and images in a large [[database]] for efficient retrieval through [[World wide web|web]]-based interfaces.&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casca.ca/lrp2010/Docs/LRPReports/astroinformatics_lrp.pdf Astroinformatics in Canada], Nicholas M. Ball, David Schade. Retrieved 1 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Another aim is to help develop new methods and software for astronomers, as well as to help facilitate the process and analysis of the rapidly growing amount of data in the field of astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Astroinformatics' helps Astronomers explore the sky|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-10-astroinformatics-astronomers-exploring-sky.html|website=Phys.org|publisher=Heidelberg University|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astroinformatics is described as the "Fourth Paradigm" of astronomical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/fourth-paradigm-data-intensive-scientific-discovery/|website=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many research areas involved with astroinformatics, such as data mining, machine learning, statistics, visualization, scientific data management, and semantic science.&lt;ref name="VOdm"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5618-2_9|chapter=Virtual Observatories, Data Mining, and Astroinformatics|title=Planets, Stars and Stellar Systems|pages=403–443|year=2013|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|isbn=978-94-007-5617-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data mining]] and [[machine learning]] play significant roles in Astroinformatics as a [[Scientific method|scientific research]] discipline due to their focus on "knowledge discovery from data" ([[data mining|KDD]]) and "learning from data".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=N.M. |last2=Brunner |first2=R.J. |title=Data Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=1049–1106 |doi=10.1142/S0218271810017160 |year=2010|arxiv=0906.2173 |bibcode=2010IJMPD..19.1049B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1063/1.3059074 |chapter=The LSST Data Mining Research Agenda |title=AIP Conference Proceedings |pages=347–351 |year=2008 |last1=Borne |first1=K |last2=Becla |first2=J |last3=Davidson |first3=I |last4=Szalay |first4=A |last5=Tyson |first5=J.

The amount of data collected from astronomical sky surveys has grown from gigabytes to terabytes throughout the past decade and is predicted to grow in the next decade into hundreds of petabytes with the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]] and into the exabytes with the [[Square Kilometre Array]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1063/1.3059076|chapter=Parametrization and Classification of 20 Billion LSST Objects: Lessons from SDSS|title=AIP Conference Proceedings|pages=359–365|year=2008|last1=Ivezić|first1=Ž|last2=Axelrod|first2=T|last3=Becker|first3=A.

A|last21=Bailer-Jones|first21=Coryn A.L|journal=Aip Conf.proc|volume=1082|arxiv=0810.5155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plethora of new data both enables and challenges effective astronomical research. Therefore, new approaches are required. In part due to this, data-driven science is becoming a recognized academic discipline. Consequently, astronomy (and other scientific disciplines) are developing information-intensive and data-intensive sub-disciplines to an extent that these sub-disciplines are now becoming (or have already become) standalone research disciplines and full-fledged academic programs. While many institutes of education do not boast an astroinformatics program, such programs most likely will be developed in the near future.

[[Informatics]] has been recently defined as "the use of digital data, information, and related services for research and knowledge generation". However the usual, or commonly used definition is "informatics is the discipline of organizing, accessing, integrating, and mining data from multiple sources for discovery and decision support." Therefore, the discipline of astroinformatics includes many naturally-related specialties including data modeling, data organization, etc. It may also include transformation and normalization methods for data integration and information visualization, as well as knowledge extraction, indexing techniques, information retrieval and data mining methods. Classification schemes (e.g., [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]], [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]], [[folksonomy|folksonomies]], and/or collaborative [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Collaborative Annotation for Scientific Data Discovery and Reuse|url=http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Apr-13/AprMay13_RDAP_Borne.html|website=Bulletin of the ASIS&amp;T|publisher=American Society for Information Science and Technology|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) plus [[Astrostatistics]] will also be heavily involved. [[Citizen science]] projects (such as [[Galaxy Zoo]]) also contribute highly valued novelty discovery, feature meta-tagging, and object characterization within large astronomy data sets. All of these specialties enable scientific discovery across varied massive data collections, collaborative research, and data re-use, in both research and learning environments.

In 2012, two position papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics in a Nutshell|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/astroinformatics-in-a-nutshell|website=asaip.psu.edu|publisher=The Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal, Penn State University|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feigelson|first1=Eric|title=Astrostatistics in a Nutshell|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/astrostatistics-in-a-nutshell|website=asaip.psu.edu|publisher=The Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal, Penn State University|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were presented to the Council of the [[American Astronomical Society]] that led to the establishment of formal working groups in Astroinformatics and [[Astrostatistics]] for the profession of [[astronomy]] within the US and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feigelson|first1=E.|last2=Ivezić|first2=Ž.|last3=Hilbe|first3=J.|last4=Borne|first4=K.|title=New Organizations to Support Astroinformatics and Astrostatistics|journal=Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems Xxii|arxiv=1301.3069|year=2013|volume=475|pages=15|bibcode=2013ASPC..475...15F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astroinformatics provides a natural context for the integration of education and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=The Revolution in Astronomy Education: Data Science for the Masses|journal=Astro2010: The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey|arxiv = 0909.3895 |year=2009|volume=2010|pages=P7|bibcode=2009astro2010P...7B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of research can now be implemented within the classroom to establish and grow [[data literacy]] through the easy re-use of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Data in the Classroom|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/usingdata/index.html|website=Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College|publisher=National Science Digital Library|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has many other uses, such as repurposing archival data for new projects, literature-data links, intelligent retrieval of information, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy|location=George Mason University, USA|url=http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2009/PosterPapers/Poster-paper18.pdf|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''innermost stable circular orbit''' (often called the '''ISCO''') is the smallest circular orbit in which a [[test particle]] can stably orbit a massive object in [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Misner | first1=Charles | last2=Thorne | first2=Kip S. | last3=Wheeler | first3=John |author1-link=Kip Thorne |author2-link=Charles W. Misner| author3-link=John Archibald Wheeler |title=Gravitation|publisher=[[W. H. Freeman and Company]]|date=1973|isbn=0-7167-0344-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of the ISCO, the ISCO-radius (&lt;math&gt;r_{\mathrm{isco}}&lt;/math&gt;), depends on the angular momentum (spin) of the central object.

The ISCO plays an important role in black hole [[accretion disks]] since it marks the inner edge of the disk.

For a non-spinning massive object, where the gravitational field can be expressed with the [[Schwarzschild metric]], the ISCO is located at,

:&lt;math&gt;r_{\mathrm{isco}} = \frac{6 \, GM}{c^2}=3 R_S, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; R_S&lt;/math&gt; is the Schwarzschild radius of the massive object with mass &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, even for a non-spinning object, the ISCO radius is only three times the [[Schwarzschild radius]], &lt;math&gt; R_S &lt;/math&gt;, suggesting that only [[Black Hole|black holes]] and [[neutron star|neutron stars]] have innermost stable circular orbits outside of their surfaces. As the angular momentum of the central object increases, &lt;math&gt;r_{\mathrm{isco}}&lt;/math&gt; decreases.

Circular orbits are still possible between the ISCO and the [[photon sphere]], but they are unstable. The photon sphere has a radius of
:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{3 \, GM}{c^2} = \frac{3 R_S}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
For a massless test particle like a photon, the only possible circular orbit is exactly at the photon sphere, and is unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sean M. |last=Carroll |authorlink=Sean M. Carroll |title=Lecture Notes on General Relativity: The Schwarzschild Solution and Black Holes |date=December 1997 |url=https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Carroll3/Carroll7.html |arxiv=gr-qc/9712019 |accessdate=2017-04-11|bibcode = 1997gr.qc....12019C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the photon sphere, no circular orbits exist.

==Rotating black holes==
The case for rotating black holes is somewhat more complicated. The equatorial ISCO in the [[Kerr metric]] depends on whether the orbit is [[Prograde motion|prograde]] (negative sign below) or [[Retrograde motion|retrograde]] (positive sign):
:&lt;math&gt;r_{\mathrm{isco}} = \frac{GM}{c^2} \left( 3 + Z_2 \pm \sqrt{(3-Z_1)(3+Z_1+2Z_2)} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;Z_1 = 1 + \sqrt[3]{1-x^2} \left( \sqrt[3]{1+x} + \sqrt[3]{1-x} \right)  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z_2 = \sqrt{3x^2 + Z_1^2} &lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;x=a/M&lt;/math&gt; as the rotation parameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bardeen |first1=James M. |authorlink1=James M.

If the particle is also spinning there is a further split in ISCO radius depending on whether the spin is aligned with or against the black hole rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Innermost stable circular orbits of spinning test particles in Schwarzschild and Kerr space-times |last1=Jefremov |first1=Paul I |last2=Tsupko |first2=Oleg Yu |last3=Bisnovatyi-Kogan |first3=Gennady S |journal=Physical Review D |volume=91 |number=12 |pages=124030 |date=15 June 2015 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.91.124030 |arxiv=1503.07060 |bibcode=2015PhRvD..91l4030J |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Oleg_Tsupko/publication/274094374_Innermost_stable_circular_orbits_of_spinning_test_particles_in_Schwarzschild_and_Kerr_space-times/links/5578b23408ae752158703b1d.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

was the branch of knowledge dedicated to the observation of astronomical bodies in order to keep the right time for the Vedic sacrifices.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnijyotisa/&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326/&gt; It is one of the six [[Vedanga]]s, or ancillary science connected with the [[Vedas]] that developed .&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnijyotisa&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit–English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA353|year=1923|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Jyotisha" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 326–327&lt;/ref&gt; This field of study was concerned with fixing the days and hours of Vedic rituals.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326/&gt;&lt;ref name="mullerhaslp210"&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Max Müller|title=A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofancient00mlle|year=1860|publisher=[[Williams and Norgate]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofancient00mlle/page/210 210]–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu astrology from the 3rd century BCE was greatly influenced by   [[Greek astrology|Greek tradition]],{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1999|pp=719–721}}{{Sfn|Pingree|1973|pp=2–3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Erik Gregersen|title=The Britannica Guide to the History of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZ3zVmLUcjcC|year=2011|publisher=[[The Rosen Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-1-61530-127-0|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326/&gt;. 
But the concept of ''Vedanga'' predates Greek contact, and there have also been later independent developments. 
Hindu astrology as it stands today is inherently a study of karma{{Sfn|BV Raman|1992|pp=23}}, which gives it a very different foundation compared to Greek astrology. In addition to this, the predictive techniques  such as Dashas (planetary and sign-based time periods), Vargas (harmonic divisions of the horoscope) are not that evolved in Greek astrology.  

==Etymology==
Jyotisha, states Monier-Williams, is rooted in the word ''Jyotish'' which means light, such as that of sun or moon or heavenly body. The term ''Jyotisha'' includes the study of astronomy, astrology and the science of timekeeping using the movements of astronomical bodies.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnijyotisa/&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326/&gt; It aimed to keep time, maintain calendar, and predict auspicious times for Vedic rituals.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnijyotisa/&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326/&gt;{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|pp=10, 35–36, 67}}

==History==
According to [[David Pingree]], the field of timekeeping in Jyotisha may have been "derived from [[Mesopotamia]] during the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] period",{{Sfn|Pingree|1973|pp=1–12}} but [[Yukio Ohashi]] considers this proposal as "definitely wrong".{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1999|p=719}} Ohashi states that this Vedanga field developed from actual astronomical studies in ancient India.{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1999|pp=719–721}} Other scholars dismiss various arguments of Pingree and K. S. Shukla points out a controversy by showing Pingree’s incorrect amendations to the manuscript of the [[Yavanajataka|Yavanajātaka]], which Pingree believed to be highly corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Mak (Kyoto University), ''[https://www.academia.edu/2451483/The_transmission_of_Greek_astral_science_to_India_reconsidered_-_Critical_remarks_on_the_contents_and_the_newly_discovered_manuscript_of_the_Yavanaj%C4%81taka The transmission of Greek astral science to India reconsidered - Critical remarks on the contents and the newly discovered manuscript of the Yavanajātaka]''. Institute for Research in Humanities, 2012.10.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The texts of Vedic Jyotisha sciences were translated into the [[Chinese language]] in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, and the Rigvedic passages on astronomy are found in the works of [[Zhu Jiangyan]] and [[Zhi Qian]].{{Sfn|Pingree|1973|p=2}}

Timekeeping as well as the nature of solar and lunar movements are mentioned in Vedic texts.{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1993|pp=185–251}} For example, Kaushitaki [[Brahmana]] chapter 19.3 mentions the shift in the relative location of the sun towards north for 6 months, and south for 6 months.{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1999|p=720}}{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|pp=35–42}}

The ancient extant text on Jyotisha is the ''[[Vedanga Jyotisha|Vedanga-Jyotisha]]'', which exists in two editions, one linked to [[Rigveda]] and other to [[Yajurveda]].{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1999|p=719}} The Rigveda version consists of 36 verses, while the Yajurveda recension has 43 verses of which 29 verses are borrowed from the Rigveda.{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|pp=35–36}}{{Sfn|Pingree|1973|p=1}} The Rigveda version is variously attributed to sage Lagadha, and sometimes to sage Shuci.{{Sfn|Pingree|1973|p=1}} The Yajurveda version credits no particular sage, has survived into the modern era with a commentary of Somakara, and is the more studied version.{{Sfn|Pingree|1973|p=1}}

The Jyotisha text ''Brahma-siddhanta'', probably composed in the 5th century CE, discusses how to use the movement of planets, sun and moon to keep time and calendar.{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|pp=67–68}} This text also lists trigonometry and mathematical formulae to support its theory of orbits, predict planetary positions and calculate relative mean positions of celestial nodes and apsides.{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|pp=67–68}} The text is notable for presenting very large integers, such as 4.32 billion years as the lifetime of the current universe.{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|pp=68–71}}

The ancient Hindu texts on Jyotisha only discuss time keeping, and never mention astrology or prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. K. Raju|title=Cultural Foundations of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jza_cNJM6fAC|year=2007|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-81-317-0871-2|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ancient texts predominantly cover astronomy, but at a rudimentary level.&lt;ref name="mullerhaslp210"/&gt; Technical horoscopes and astrology ideas in India came from Greece and developed in the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Campion|title=Astrology and Cosmology in the World’s Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxSr1NT3BLoC|year=2012|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8147-0842-2|pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1999|pp=719–721}}{{Sfn|Pingree|1973|pp=2–3}} Later medieval era texts such as the ''Yavana-jataka'' and the ''Siddhanta'' texts are more astrology-related.{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|pp=116–120, 259–261}}

==Discussion==
The field of Jyotisha deals with ascertaining time, particularly forecasting auspicious day and time for Vedic rituals.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326/&gt; The field of Vedanga structured time into ''Yuga'' which was a 5-year interval,{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|p=36}} divided into multiple lunisolar intervals such as 60 solar months, 61 savana months, 62 synodic months and 67 sidereal months.{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1999|p=719}} A Vedic Yuga had 1,860 ''tithis'' ({{lang|sa|तिथि}}, dates), and it defined a ''savana''-day (civil day) from one sunrise to another.{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1993|pp=185–251}}

The Rigvedic version of Jyotisha may be a later insertion into the Veda, states David Pingree, possibly between 513 and 326 BCE, when  Indus valley was occupied by the Achaemenid from Mesopotamia.{{Sfn|Pingree|1973|p=3}} The mathematics and devices for time keeping mentioned in these ancient Sanskrit texts, proposes Pingree, such as the water clock may also have arrived in India from Mesopotamia. However, Yukio Ohashi considers this proposal as incorrect,{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1999|pp=719–721}} suggesting instead that the Vedic timekeeping efforts, for forecasting appropriate time for rituals, must have begun much earlier and the influence may have flowed from India to Mesopotamia.{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1993|pp=185–251}} Ohashi states that it is incorrect to assume that the number of civil days in a year equal 365 in both Hindu and Egyptian–Persian year.{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1999|pp=719–720}} Further, adds Ohashi, the Mesopotamian formula is different from the Indian formula for calculating time, each can only work for their respective latitude, and either would make major errors in predicting time and calendar in the other region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yukio Ohashi|editor=S.M. Ansari|title=History of Oriental Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8X0iCQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=[[Springer Science]]|isbn=978-94-015-9862-0|pages=75–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Asko Parpola, the Jyotisha and luni-solar calendar discoveries in ancient India, and similar discoveries in China in "great likelihood result from convergent parallel development", and not from diffusion from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asko Parpola]] (2013), "Beginnings of Indian Astronomy, with Reference to a Parallel Development in China", ''History of Science in South Asia'', Vol. 1, pages 21–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim Plofker states that while a flow of timekeeping ideas from either side is plausible, each may have instead developed independently, because the loan-words typically seen when ideas migrate are missing on both sides as far as words for various time intervals and techniques.{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|pp=41–42}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sarma | first=Nataraja | title=Diffusion of astronomy in the ancient world | journal=Endeavour | publisher=[[Elsevier]] | volume=24 | issue=4 | year=2000 | pages=157–164 | doi=10.1016/s0160-9327(00)01327-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, adds Plofker, and other scholars, that the discussion of time keeping concepts are found in the Sanskrit verses of the ''Shatapatha Brahmana'', a 2nd millennium BCE text.{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|pp=41–42}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helaine Selin| title=Astronomy Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRHvCAAAQBAJ |year=2012 |publisher=Springer Science| isbn=978-94-011-4179-6 |pages=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water clock and sun dials are mentioned in many ancient Hindu texts such as the [[Arthashastra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hinuber | first=Oskar V. | title=Probleme der Technikgeschichte im alten Indien | journal=Saeculum | publisher=[[Bohlau Verlag]] | volume=29 | issue=3 | year=1978 | doi=10.7788/saeculum.1978.29.3.215 | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kauṭilya|author2=Patrick Olivelle (Translator) |title=King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India: Kautilya's Arthasastra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MlgU0oQb4sC |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-989182-5|pages=473 with note 1.7.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some integration of [[Mesopotamian]] and Indian Jyotisha-based systems may have occurred in a roundabout way, states Plofker, after the arrival of Greek astrology ideas in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Kim Plofker| editor=Micah Ross| title=From the Banks of the Euphrates: Studies in Honor of Alice Louise Slotsky| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edVOGJKa7XUC| year=2008| publisher=[[Eisenbrauns]]|isbn=978-1-57506-144-3| pages=193–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jyotisha texts present mathematical formulae to predict the length of day time, sun rise and moon cycles.{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1993|pp=185–251}}{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|pp=35–40}}{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|1963|p=269}} For example,

:The length of daytime = &lt;math&gt;\left(12 + \frac{2}{61}n \right)&lt;/math&gt; ''muhurtas''{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|p=37}}
:where ''n'' is the number of days after or before the winter solstice, and one ''muhurta'' equals {{frac|1|30}} of a day (48 minutes).{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1999|p=720}}

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 6px #FFE0BB;padding:1.0em"&gt;
'''Water clock'''&lt;br&gt;A ''prastha'' of water [is] the increase in day, [and] decrease in night in the [sun's] northern motion; vice versa in the southern. [There is] a six-muhurta [difference] in a half year.

'''''Aperture Photometry Tool''''' (APT) is [[software]] with a [[graphical user interface]] for computing [[aperture]] [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] on astronomical imagery. Image overlays, graphical representations, statistics, models, options and controls for aperture-photometry calculations are brought together into a single package. The software also can be utilized as a [[FITS]]-image viewer. APT is executed on desktop and laptop computers, and is free of charge under a license that limits its use to astronomical research and education. The software may be downloaded from its [http://www.aperturephotometry.org official website], and requires the [[Java Virtual Machine]] to be installed on the user's computer.

== History ==

The initial version of APT was released on November 2, 2007. The latest version is APT v. 2.8.4, released on April 22, 2020. The software was developed by [https://www.linkedin.com/in/russ-laher-ph-d-mba-a2a57918 Dr. Russ Laher], a member of the professional staff at the Spitzer Science Center, part of the [[Infrared Processing and Analysis Center]] (IPAC) at the [[California Institute of Technology]].
A paper on APT was published in July 2012 in the journal ''Publications of the Astronomy Society of the Pacific''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aperture Photometry Tool |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific  |date=July 2012 |volume=124 |issue=917 |pages=737–763|author1=Laher |first1=Russ R. |last2=Gorjian |first2=Varoujan |last3=Rebull |first3=Luisa M. |last4=Masci |first4=Frank J. |last5=Fowler |first5=John W. |last6=Helou |first6=George |last7=Kulkarni |first7=Shrinivas R. |last8=Law |first8=Nicholas M. |bibcode=2012PASP..124..737L |doi=10.1086/666883 |url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/34358/1/666883.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A companion paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aperture Photometry Tool Versus SExtractor for Noncrowded Fields |journal=Publications of the Astronomy Society of the Pacific |date=July 2012 |volume=124 |issue=917 |pages=764–781|author1=Laher |first1=Russ R. |last2=Rebull |first2=Luisa M. |last3=Gorjian |first3=Varoujan |display-authors=etal|doi=10.1086/666507 }}&lt;/ref&gt; compares the performance of APT vs. SExtractor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=SExtractor: Software for Source Extraction |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement Series |date=June 1996 |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=393–404|author1=Bertin |first1=E. |last2=Arnouts |first2=S. |bibcode = 1996A&amp;AS..117..393B |doi = 10.1051/aas:1996164 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; an established command-line software program for aperture photometry.

== Aperture and Sky Annulus ==

Aperture geometry, size, and location in the image are important parameters in aperture photometry.  APT allows circular and elliptical shapes for apertures and sky annuli (the latter are used for background estimation).  The rotation can be controlled in the case of an ellipse.
The sky annulus will have the same shape as the aperture, but with larger inner and outer radii than the aperture.
Although there is no hard limitation on the size, it is practically limited by the software's response time in the calculation for a large aperture and sky annulus, and the tool for the user to interactively specify the size parameters includes a subimage that is only about 80 pixels on a side (at this time). The aperture is placed on the desired image location with a mouse click.  Options to allow minor adjustments of the aperture position via centroiding are available.  APT also has pixel-zapping functionality, which can be used to temporarily set the value of select pixels to NaN (not a number), effectively removing them from the aperture-photometry calculations.

== Sky Coordinates ==

For aperture photometry on an astronomical image, it is often useful to know the sky coordinates of an image pixel. APT computes and displays sky coordinates if keywords that define a World Coordinate System (WCS) are present in the header of the FITS-image file.  APT handles the commonly used tangent or gnomonic projection (TAN, TPV, and SIP subtypes), as well as the sine (a.k.a. orthographic), Cartesian, and Aitoff projections(the latter is probably only useful for display purposes).
 
Recent updates to APT include the ability to read FITS image files which use a Pixel Coordinate matrix (PCM), such as that used by the [[Pan-STARRS|Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System]].&lt;ref name=APT_1&gt;{{cite web| title=Aperture Photometry Tool News| url=http://www.aperturephotometry.org/aptool/news| publisher=Aperture Photometry Tool| date=12 December 2018| access-date=15 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APT calculates geometric image distortion only for the tangent projection at this time. Two distortion conventions are supported,
which are the two major methods employed in modern astronomy.  The SIPconvention is applied for images with CTYPE1  = 'RA---TAN-SIP' and
CTYPE2  = 'DEC—TAN-SIP'.  In the absence of SIP keywords, APT will attempt to read in and apply any PV distortion keywords in the
FITS header for images with either CTYPE1  = 'RA---TAN' and CTYPE2  = 'DEC—TAN' or with CTYPE1  = 'RA---TPV' and CTYPE2  = 'DEC—TPV'.
APT computes SIP distortion up to ninth polynomial order and PV distortion up to seventh polynomial order.

== Java Requirements ==

APT is written in the Java computing language.  The latest APT version was built with the JDK 1.6.0_65 on a Mac laptop running OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.  Generally, APT can be executed with JRE versions greater than 1.6, since Java is "forward-compatible"; however, on some machines, later Java versions might give a "Surface not cacheable error", in which case trying a different Java version is the recommended workaround (at this time).  On Macs, Java 1.6 (or so-called legacy Java 6) is required for APT to run as a double-click application (and APT might not work as a double-click application on some later versions of OS X), but APT generally works with higher versions of Java on the Mac if the wrapper script APT.csh is executed from a terminal window to start APT running.

In [[astronomy]], the '''Goldreich-Kylafis''' (GK) effect causes certain molecular line emission to be weakly [[Linear polarization|linearly polarized]], e.g., in the presence of a [[magnetic field]]. More specifically it is predicted that interstellar [[Spectral line|spectral lines]] possess a few percent linear polarization provided that the [[Optical depth (astrophysics)|optical depth]] in the source region is both [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] and of order unity and the [[Spontaneous emission|radiative rates]] are at least comparable to the collision rates.  Compared to polarized dust emission, the GK effect has the potential to yield additional information along the line of sight through its dependence on velocity in the line profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0810.2844 |title=[0810.2844&amp;#93; Observations of the Goldreich-Kylafis effect in star-forming regions with XPOL at the IRAM 30m telescope |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |volume=492 |issue=3 |pages=757 |date=2008-10-16 |last1=Forbrich |first1=Jan |last2=Wiesemeyer |first2=Helmut |last3=Thum |first3=Clemens |last4=Belloche |first4=Arnaud |last5=Menten |first5=Karl M |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:200811056 |bibcode=2008A&amp;A...492..757F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical background of the work was published by [[Peter Goldreich]] and - his postdoc at the time - [http://www.physics.uoc.gr/en/faculty/n.kylafis Nick Kylafis]  in a series of two papers in [[The Astrophysical Journal]] in [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981ApJ...243L..75G/abstract 1981] and [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982ApJ...253..606G/abstract 1982]

This '''glossary of astronomy''' is a list of definitions of terms and concepts relevant to [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]], their sub-disciplines, and related fields. Astronomy is concerned with the study of [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[celestial event|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[atmosphere of Earth]]. The field of astronomy features an extensive vocabulary and a significant amount of jargon.

{{defn|}}

{{term|[[axial precession]]}}
{{defn|A slow, continuous, gravity-induced change (a {{gli|precession}}) in the orientation of an {{gli|astronomical body}}'s {{gli|axis of rotation}}. The term often refers in particular to the gradual shift in the orientation of [[Earth's rotation|Earth's rotational axis]] with respect to {{gli|ecliptic|its orbital plane}} over a cycle of approximately 25,772 years, which is caused predominantly by the gravitational influence of the {{gli|Moon}} and the {{gli|Sun}} on the Earth's [[equatorial bulge]].

{{anchor|rotational axis}}{{term|[[axis of rotation]]}}
{{defn|}}

{{defn|The common [[center of mass]] about which any two or more bodies of a gravitationally bound system {{gli|orbit}}. The barycenter is one of the [[focus (geometry)|foci]] of the {{gli|elliptical orbit}} of each body participating in the system; its location is strongly influenced by the [[mass]] of each body and the distances between them. For example, in a {{gli|planetary system}} where the mass of the central {{gli|star}} is significantly larger than the mass of an orbiting {{gli|planet}}, the barycenter may actually be located within the radius of the star, such that the planet appears to orbit the star itself, though both bodies actually orbit the shared barycenter.}}

{{defn|A {{gli|substellar object}} that is too low in mass to sustain the [[nuclear fusion]] of [[hydrogen-1]] in its core, with the latter being a characteristic of stars on the {{gli|main sequence}}.

{{term|[[constellation]]}}
{{defn|A region on the {{gli|celestial sphere}} surrounding a specific and identifiable grouping of stars.

{{defn|Any of a set of points near two large {{gli|astronomical body|bodies}} in {{gli|orbit}} at which a smaller object will maintain a constant position relative to the larger bodies.

For each combination of two orbital bodies, there are five such Lagrangian points, typically identified with the labels ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to astronomy:

'''[[Astronomy]]''' &amp;ndash; studies the [[universe]] beyond Earth, including its [[physical cosmology|formation and development]], and the evolution, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] (such as [[galaxy|galaxies]], [[planet]]s, etc.) and [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[atmosphere of Earth]] (such as the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic background radiation]]).

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Nature of astronomy==
Astronomy can be described as all the following:

* An [[academic discipline]]: one with academic departments, curricula and degrees; national and international societies; and specialized journals.
* A scientific field (a branch of [[science]]) &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies it
** A [[natural science]] &amp;ndash; one that seeks to elucidate the rules that govern the [[nature|natural]] world using [[Empirical method|empirical]] and [[scientific method]]s.
*** A branch or field of [[space science]]
* A [[Amateur astronomy|hobby or part-time pursuit]] for the satisfaction of personal [[curiosity]] or appreciation of [[beauty]], the latter especially including [[astrophotography]].

==Branches of astronomy==
* [[Astrobiology]] &amp;ndash; studies the advent and [[evolution]] of [[biological system]]s in the universe.
* [[Astrophysics]] &amp;ndash; branch of [[astronomy]] that deals with the [[physics]] of the [[universe]], including the physical properties of [[astronomical object|celestial object]]s, as well as their interactions and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=astrophysics | publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astrophysics | accessdate=2011-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the objects studied are [[galaxy|galaxies]], [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[exoplanet]]s, the [[interstellar medium]] and the [[cosmic microwave background]]; and the properties examined include [[luminosity]], [[density]], [[temperature]], and [[chemistry|chemical]] composition. The subdisciplines of theoretical astrophysics are:
** [[Compact objects]] &amp;ndash; this subdiscipline studies very dense matter in [[white dwarf]]s and [[neutron star]]s and their effects on environments including [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]].
** [[Physical cosmology]] &amp;ndash; origin and evolution of the universe as a whole. The study of cosmology is theoretical astrophysics at its largest scale.
** [[Computational astrophysics]] &amp;ndash; The study of astrophysics using computational methods and tools to develop computational models.
** [[Galactic astronomy]] &amp;ndash; deals with the structure and components of our galaxy and of other galaxies.
** [[High energy astrophysics]] &amp;ndash; studies phenomena occurring at high energies including [[active galactic nuclei]], [[supernova]]e, [[gamma-ray burst]]s, [[quasar]]s, and [[Bow shock|shock]]s.
** [[Interstellar astrophysics]] &amp;ndash; study of the [[interstellar medium]], [[intergalactic medium]] and [[cosmic dust|dust]].
** [[Extragalactic astronomy]] &amp;ndash; study of objects (mainly galaxies) outside our galaxy, including [[Galaxy formation and evolution]].
** [[Astronomy#Stellar astronomy|Stellar astronomy]] &amp;ndash; concerned with [[Star formation]], physical properties, [[main sequence]] life span, [[variable star|variability]], [[stellar evolution]] and extinction.
** [[Plasma astrophysics]] &amp;ndash; studies properties of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in outer space.
** [[Relativistic astrophysics]] &amp;ndash; studies effects of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]] in astrophysical contexts including [[gravitational waves]], [[gravitational lens]]ing and [[black hole]]s.
** [[Solar physics]] &amp;ndash; Sun and its interaction with the remainder of the Solar System and interstellar space.
* [[Planetary Science]] &amp;ndash; study of planets, moons, and planetary systems.
** [[Atmospheric science]] &amp;ndash; study of atmospheres and weather.
** [[Exoplanetology]] &amp;ndash; various planets outside of the Solar System
** [[Planetary formation]] &amp;ndash; formation of planets and moons in the context of the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]].
** [[Planetary rings]] &amp;ndash; dynamics, stability, and composition of planetary rings
** [[Magnetosphere]]s &amp;ndash; magnetic fields of planets and moons
** [[Planetary surface]]s &amp;ndash; surface geology of planets and moons
** [[Planetary interiors]] &amp;ndash; interior composition of planets and moons
** [[Small Solar System bodies]] &amp;ndash; smallest gravitationally bound bodies, including [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[Kuiper belt object]]s.
* Astronomy divided by general technique used for astronomical research:
** [[Astrometry]] &amp;ndash; study of the position of objects in the sky and their changes of position. Defines the system of coordinates used and the [[kinematics]] of objects in our galaxy.
** [[Observational astronomy]] &amp;ndash; practice of observing celestial objects by using telescopes and other astronomical apparatus. It is concerned with recording data. The subdisciplines of [[observational astronomy]] are generally made by the specifications of the detectors: 
*** [[Radio astronomy]] &amp;ndash; Above 300&amp;nbsp;µm
*** [[Submillimetre astronomy]] &amp;ndash; 200&amp;nbsp;µm to 1&amp;nbsp;mm
*** [[Infrared astronomy]] &amp;ndash; 0.7–350&amp;nbsp;µm
*** [[Optical astronomy]] &amp;ndash; 380–750&amp;nbsp;nm
*** [[Ultraviolet astronomy]] &amp;ndash; 10–320&amp;nbsp;nm
*** [[X-ray astronomy]] &amp;ndash; 0.01–10&amp;nbsp;nm
*** [[Gamma-ray astronomy]] &amp;ndash; Below 0.01&amp;nbsp;nm
*** [[Cosmic ray astronomy]] &amp;ndash; [[Cosmic ray]]s, including plasma
*** [[Neutrino astronomy]] &amp;ndash; [[Neutrino]]s
*** [[Gravitational wave astronomy]] &amp;ndash; [[Graviton]]s
** [[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometry]] &amp;ndash; study of how bright celestial objects are when passed through different filters

A '''dark-sky preserve''' ('''DSP''') is an area, usually surrounding a park or [[observatory]], that restricts artificial [[light pollution]]. The purpose of a dark sky preserve is generally to promote [[astronomy]]. Because different national organizations have worked independently to create their programs, different terms have been used to describe the areas. This has led to confusion between the terms ''reserve'', ''preserve'', and ''park''. The [[International Dark-Sky Association]] (IDA) chooses ''reserve'' to avoid confusion with ''park'', when using the initialisms "IDSR" (International Dark Sky Reserve) and "IDSP" (International Dark Sky Park).

In 1993, [[Michigan]] became the first state in the United States to designate a tract of land as a "Dark Sky Preserve" at the [[Lake Hudson State Recreation Area]].

In 1999, the first permanent preserve was established at Torrance Barrens in the [[District Municipality of Muskoka|Muskoka]] region of southern [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="RCGS"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Peter McMahon |title=Preserving the night sky: Dark-sky preserves in Canada |url=https://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/preserving-night-sky-dark-sky-preserves-canada |website=Canadian Geographic |publisher=Royal Canadian Geographical Society |accessdate=16 July 2018 |language=en |date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, protection zones around observatories existed well before the creation of that preserve.

The IDA recognizes protected areas worldwide. The [[Mont Mégantic Observatory]] in Quebec is the first such site to be recognized (in 2007) as International Dark Sky Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =First International Dark Sky Reserve Is Announced in Québec!| publisher =International Dark-Sky Association| date =2007-09-21| url =http://data.nextrionet.com/site/idsa/PR_Mont_Megantic_2007.pdf| accessdate =2008-11-26| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081115023048/http://data.nextrionet.com/site/idsa/PR_Mont_Megantic_2007.pdf| archivedate =2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
IDA has also recognized [[Natural Bridges National Monument]] in [[Utah]] as the world's first International Dark Sky Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Utah's Natural Bridges National Monument Becomes First International Dark Sky Park| publisher =International Dark-Sky Association| date =2007-04-19| url =http://data.nextrionet.com/site/idsa/PR_Natural_Bridges_2007.pdf| accessdate =2008-11-26| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081115023700/http://data.nextrionet.com/site/idsa/PR_Natural_Bridges_2007.pdf| archivedate =2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has established an extensive standard for dark sky preserves that addresses lighting within the DSP and influences from [[skyglow]] from urban areas in the region. This was based on the work of the [[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]]. There are no other established standards for dark sky preserves. Outside Canada, such designations are generally through self-proclamation. As a result, the validity of such a designation may be dubious. In some cases, dark sky preserves are neither dark nor protected.

It is generally understood that a Dark Sky Preserve, or Dark Sky Reserve, should be sufficiently dark to promote astronomy. However this is not always the case. The lighting protocol for a Dark Sky Preserve is based on the sensitivity of wildlife to artificial light at night (ALAN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rasc.ca/sites/default/files/RASC%20DSP%20GOL%20-%20Summer%202013_0.pdf |title=Royal Astronomical Society of Canada: Guidelines for Outdoor Lighting in Dark-sky Preserves (RASC-DSP-GOL) |website=rasc.ca |access-date=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the IDA introduced the term "Dark Sky Sanctuary" and designated the [[Elqui Valley (wine region)|Elqui Valley]] of northern Chile as the world's first International Dark Sky Sanctuary. The [[Gabriela Mistral]] Dark Sky Sanctuary is named after a Chilean poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darksky.org/chilean-astronomical-site-becomes-worlds-first-international-dark-sky-sanctuary/ |title=Chilean Astronomical Site Becomes World's First International Dark Sky Sanctuary |last= |first= |date=2015-08-09 |publisher=IDA |language=en-US |access-date=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark Sky Places==
The [[International Dark-Sky Association|IDA]]'s Dark Sky Places program offers five types of designations:
* '''International Dark Sky Communities''' – Communities are legally organised cities and towns that adopt quality outdoor lighting ordinances and undertake efforts to educate residents about the importance of dark skies.
* '''International Dark Sky Parks''' – Parks are publicly or privately owned spaces protected for natural conservation that implement good outdoor lighting and provide dark sky programs for visitors.
* '''International Dark Sky Reserves''' – Reserves consist of a dark "core" zone surrounded by a populated periphery where policy controls are enacted to protect the darkness of the core.
* '''International Dark Sky Sanctuaries''' – Sanctuaries are the most remote (and often darkest) places in the world whose conservation state is most fragile.
* '''Dark Sky Developments of Distinction''' – Developments of Distinction recognize subdivisions, master planned communities, and unincorporated neighborhoods and townships whose planning actively promotes a more natural night sky but does not qualify them for the International Dark Sky Community designation.

Further designations include "Dark Sky Nation", given to the [[Kaibab Indian Reservation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darksky.org/the-worlds-first-ida-dark-sky-nation/ |title=The World's First IDA Dark Sky Nation |first=Tim |last=Hunter |date=August 28, 2015 |publisher=IDA |access-date=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Parashant International Night Sky Province-Window to the Cosmos", given to [[Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/para/learn/news/dark-sky-status.htm |title=Parashant Receives International Dark Sky Status |date=February 21, 2014 |access-date=September 13, 2016 |publisher=[[National Park Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
===Canada===
In the Canadian program, lighting within the area must be strictly controlled to minimize the impact of artificial lighting on wildlife. These guidelines are more stringent than in other countries that lack the extensive wilderness areas that still exist in Canada. The management of a Canadian DSP extends their outreach programs from the public that visit the site to include the promotion of better lighting policies in surrounding urban areas. Currently, dark-sky preserves have more control over internal and external lighting than other programs.

With the increase in regional [[light pollution]], some observatories have actively worked with cities in their region to establish protection zones where there is controlled light pollution. These areas may not yet have been declared dark-sky preserves.

Although dark-sky preserve designations are generally sought by astronomers, it is clear that preserving natural darkness has positive effects on the health of nocturnal wildlife within the parks.  For example, the nocturnal [[black-footed ferret]] was reintroduced to the [[Grasslands National Park]] dark-sky preserve and the success of the reintroduction is enhanced by the pristine natural darkness maintained within the park by the DSP agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Government of Canada reintroduces lost species to the prairie wilderness| publisher =Parks Canada| date =2009-10-02| url =http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/cp-nr/release_e.asp?id=1443&amp;andor1=nr| accessdate =2010-12-01| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131017121008/http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/cp-nr/release_e.asp?id=1443&amp;andor1=nr| archivedate =2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lowercase}}

The abbreviation '''kyr''' means "thousand years".

Kyr was formerly common in some [[English language]] works, especially in [[geology]] and [[astronomy]], for the [[physical unit|unit]] of 1,000 years or [[millennium]]. The "k" is the [[SI prefix|unit prefix]] for [[kilo-]] or thousand with the suffix "yr" simply an abbreviation for "year".

Occasionally, the "k" is shown in [[upper case]], as in "100 Kyr"; this is an incorrect usage.  "kyr" itself is often considered incorrect, with some preferring to use "ky".

[[ISO 80000-3]] recommends usage of ka (for [[kiloannum]]), which avoids the implicit English bias of "year" by using a [[Latin]] root.

A '''billion years''' (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[year]]s) is a unit of time on the [[petasecond]] scale, more precisely equal to {{val|3.16|e=16}} [[second]]s.

It is sometimes abbreviated  '''Gy''', '''Ga''' ("giga-annum"), '''Byr''' and variants. The abbreviations '''Gya''' or '''bya''' are for "billion years ago", i.e. billion years [[before present]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Yarus |date=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-YLBMmJE1WwC&amp;pg=PA38 |title=Life from an RNA World: The Ancestor Within |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=0-674-05075-4 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The terms are  used in [[geology]], [[paleontology]], [[geophysics]],  [[astronomy]], and [[physical cosmology]].

The prefix [[giga-]] is preferred to [[billion]]- to avoid confusion in the [[long and short scales]] over the meaning of billion; the postfix [[annum]] may be further qualified for precision as a [[sidereal year]] or [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]]:
:1&amp;nbsp;Ga&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;={{val|3.15576|e=16}}&amp;nbsp;s,
:1&amp;nbsp;Ga&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;={{val|3.15581|e=16}}&amp;nbsp;s (epoch [[J2000.0]]).
:1&amp;nbsp;Ga&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;={{val|1|e=9}}&amp;nbsp;y

Byr was formerly used in [[English-language]] geology and astronomy as a [[physical unit|unit]] of one [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] [[year]]s. Subsequently, the term [[gigaannum]] (Ga) has increased in usage, with Gy or Gyr still sometimes used in English-language works (at the risk of confusion with Gy as abbreviation for the [[gray (unit)|gray]], a unit of radiation exposure). Astronomers use '''Gyr '''or''' Gy''' as an abbreviation for '''gigayear'''.&lt;ref name="sel07"&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=2007A&amp;A...476.1373S | author=Selsis | title=Habitable planets around the star Gl 581? | journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] | volume=476 | issue=3 | year=2007 | pages =1373–1387 | doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20078091 | last2=Kasting | first2=J.

{{lowercase title}}
The abbreviation '''myr''', "million years", is a [[unit of measurement|unit]] of a quantity of {{val|fmt=commas|1000000}} (i.e. {{val|1|e=6}}) years, or 31.536 [[Terasecond and longer#Teraseconds|teraseconds]].

==Usage==
Myr (Million years) is in common use where the term is often written, such as in [[Earth science]] and [[cosmology]]. Myr is also used as with MYA ("Million Years Ago"). Together they make a reference system, one to a quantity, the other to a particular place in a [[calendar era|year numbering system]] that is ''time before the present''.

Myr is deprecated in [[geology]], but in [[astronomy]] ''myr'' is standard.
Where "myr" ''is'' seen in geology it is usually "Myr" (a unit of mega-years). In astronomy it is usually "Myr" (Million years).

== Debate ==
In geology the debate of the millennia concerns the use of ''myr'' remains open concerning "the use of ''Myr'' plus ''Mya''" versus "using ''Mya'' only".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mozley|first=Peter|title=Discussion of GSA Time Unit Conventions|url=https://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/|work=web page|publisher=[[Geological Society of America]]|accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In either case the term ''[[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]'' is used in geology literature conforming to [[ISO 31-1]] (now [[ISO 80000-3]]) and NIST 811 recommended practices. Traditional style geology literature is written {{Quote|The Cretaceous started 145 Ma and ended 66 Ma, lasting for 79 Myr.}}
The "ago" is implied, so that any such year number "X Ma" between 66 and 145 is "Cretaceous", for good reason. But the counter argument is that having ''myr'' for a duration and ''Mya'' for an age mixes unit systems, and tempts capitalization errors: "million" need not be capitalized, but "mega" must be; "ma" would technically imply a ''milliyear'' (a thousandth of a year, or 8 hours). On this side of the debate, one avoids ''myr'' and simply adds ''ago'' explicitly (or adds ''[[Before Present|BP]]''), as in {{Quote|The Cretaceous started 145 Ma ago and ended 66 Ma ago, lasting for 79 Ma.}}
In this case, "79 Ma" means only a quantity of 79 million years, without the meaning of "79 million years ago".

[[File:Revelation 12 Sign.gif|thumb|The alignment on September 23, 2017]]
The '''Revelation 12 sign prophecy''' is an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic belief]] that an astronomical alignment on September 23, 2017 fulfilled the first two verses of [[Revelation 12]].  This date coincided with the Autumnal equinox and the end of the Catholic September [[Ember days|Ember Days]]. This theory, promoted by some Christians and Christian news organizations, proposed that a literal fulfillment of the prophecy made in the [[Book of Revelation]] [[Revelation 12:1|12:1]]-2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12:1-2&amp;version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Revelation 12:1-2 - ,King James Version|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; occurred on this date over [[Jerusalem]].

The passage in the [[Book of Revelation]] [[Revelation 12:1|12:1]]-[[Revelation 12:3|3]] describes "a woman clothed with sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth." ([[New International Version|NIV]]).&lt;ref name="Rev12"&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0769.html Saunder, Rev. William.

Some of the most common Christian interpretations of this passage interpret the woman as [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] or [[ancient Israel]], the man child as the [[incarnation of Jesus|incarnate Jesus]] and the (''teknon'') child being the Body of Christ, and the woman's other offspring as the Church that forms during the tribulation.&lt;ref name="Rev12"/&gt;

==Overview==

On April 7, 2011, William Tapley's channel ThirdEagleBooks published the first video about the alignment entitled "Stellarium" giving the 2017 date of the great sign and explaining how the planetary alignment that year matched the text of Revelation 12 better than a 2011 alignments, which he said three earlier videos from other people had mentioned.&lt;ref name="tapley"/&gt; A few months later, on July 30, 2011, Scott Clarke from ERF Ministries posted a video on [[YouTube]] describing the alignment.

During 2011, Scott Clarke continued to popularize the alignment on YouTube. On December 10, 2012, [[Unsealed World News]] suggested that the purported sign might be connected to the [[rapture]] of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=God's Calendar: A Shocking Story|date=December 10, 2012 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2012/12/gods-redemptive-calendar-shocking-story.html |access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2017, Luis B. Vega connected the sign to a "Conception Comet".&lt;ref name="ALittleStrength"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alittlestrength.com/articles/2017/1705-exit-sign.htm|title=The Exit Sign|last=Lauer|first=Greg|date=May 2017|website=A Little Strength|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Apocalypse of John]] describes "a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head." Proponents of the ''Revelation 12 Sign'' say that the woman represents the constellation Virgo and the crown of twelve stars represents the nine stars of the constellation Leo in conjunction with Mercury, Mars, and Venus. The moon appears to be under the "feet" of the constellation Virgo in September 2017 and the sun will be passing through the constellation, which proponents interpret as the woman being "clothed with the sun".&lt;ref name="Compendium"/&gt; The second verse of the twelfth chapter of [[Apocalypse of John|John's Apocalypse]] goes on to say that the woman "was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth."  Some people suggest this will be fulfilled because the planet [[Jupiter]] will be traversing the constellation after having undergone [[apparent retrograde motion]] after entering what they perceive to be Virgo's "womb" around November 20, 2016.&lt;ref name="FiveDoves"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fivedoves.com/letters/july2017/luisv730.htm|title=Revelation 12 sign - Conception Comet C/2017 E1|website=www.fivedoves.com|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter exits the lower part of the "womb" 42 weeks later, which is the approximate length of a human gestation (normal gestation periods lasting from 37 to 42 weeks).
[[File:Preg web final.gif|right|thumb|400px|The 42 week gestation of Jupiter]]

It was also discovered that the apparent retrograde of [[Jupiter]] in the womb of Virgo was preceded by C/2017 E1 (Comet Borisov) which is being called the ''Conception Comet''.  This comet traveled from the loins of the constellation Leo to the womb of the constellation Virgo on November 17, 2016,&lt;ref name="FiveDoves" /&gt; just before the entrance of Jupiter into the womb.  Some proponents of the Revelation 12 Sign are suggesting that this comet represented the divine insemination of the woman, which subsequently produced the male child (Jupiter). This will be the comet's only trip through our solar system as it is not a solar orbital. The complete astronomical alignment occurred on September 23, 2017, over Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Compendium"/&gt;

The Revelation 12 Sign may have coincided with the [[High Holy Day]] of [[Rosh Hashanah]] on the Jewish calendar, which is also called the ''Feast of Trumpets''. The Feast of Trumpets is the first of the Fall Feasts and its timing is traditionally based on the visibility of the new moon,&lt;ref name=templewitness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templeinstitute.org/rosh_hashana/late_arrival.htm |title=The Temple Institute: Rosh HaShana in the Holy Temple: The Late Arrival of a Witness |accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 2017 is began on the evening of September 20 and ended on the evening of the 22nd .&lt;ref name=jewcal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/month.asp?tdate=9/29/2017 |title=September, 2017 - Jewish Calendar |accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year celebration, in this case marking the end of the year 5777 (sometimes abbreviated to the [[777 (number)#Religious significance|significant number 777]]) and the beginning of 5778.

Interpretations of Revelation 12 vary, but the general consensus of those who promoted this theory was that the September 2017 alignment was the Great Sign which is described in this passage of Scripture: that the woman represents the nation of Israel, which they believe is about to enter into a multi-year period of [[Tribulation]], and the male child represents the global [[Church invisible|Church]], which might be [[rapture]]d to [[Heaven]] before the Tribulation period begins according to Revelation 12:5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+12:5&amp;version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Revelation 12:5 - King James Version|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many proponents say that in order for people to escape before this impending judgment on the world and be "raptured", they must accept that the Christian Messiah [[Jesus Christ]] died for their sins, rose again, and is the only means of being reconciled to God. These views are shared by all of the major proponents of the Revelation 12 Sign Prophecy.&lt;ref name="Compendium"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revelation 12 – The Sign for Israel|date=February 4, 2017|author=Daniel Matson|work=Signs of the End |url=http://watchfortheday.org/signofisrael.html |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About Salvation - Get Washed Clean!|author=Scott Clarke|work=ERF Ministries |url=http://erfministries.com/blog_salvation.php |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revelation 12 Sign|work=Revelation 12 Daily |url=https://rev12daily.blogspot.com/p/basic.html |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media attention and criticism==
The Revelation 12 Sign has received media attention including from ''[[The Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref name=WaPo /&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's the end of the world as we know it — again|date=June 19, 2017 |author=Alex Beam|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/06/18/end-world-know-again/iBdTo7vWNgsFoeQWLeHR6I/story.html |accessdate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Catholic Astronomer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biblical Signs in the Sky?

A number of critics have offered rebuttals of the purported sign arguing that the sign is not unique or is only [[astrology]].

'''Multi-messenger astronomy''' is [[astronomy]] based on the coordinated observation and interpretation of disparate "messenger" signals. Interplanetary probes can visit objects within the Solar System, but beyond that, information must rely on "extrasolar messengers". The four extrasolar messengers are [[electromagnetic radiation]], [[gravitational wave]]s, [[neutrino]]s, and [[cosmic ray]]s.  They are created by different astrophysical processes, and thus reveal different information about their sources.

The main multi-messenger sources outside the [[heliosphere]] are expected to be compact binary pairs ([[black hole]]s and [[neutron star]]s), [[supernovae]], irregular neutron stars, [[gamma-ray burst]]s, [[active galactic nuclei]], and [[relativistic jet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartos|first1=Imre|last2=Kowalski|first2=Marek|title=Multimessenger Astronomy|year=2017|publisher=IOP Publishing|doi=10.1088/978-0-7503-1369-8|bibcode=2017muas.book.....B|isbn=978-0-7503-1369-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multimessenger Astronomy with Neutrinos|first=Anna|last=Franckowiak|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume=888|issue=12009|page=012009|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012009|bibcode=2017JPhCS.888a2009F|year=2017|doi-access=free}}

* '''August 2017''': A [[Neutron star merger|neutron star collision]] in the galaxy [[NGC 4993]] produced the gravitational wave signal [[GW170817]], which was observed by the [[LIGO]]/[[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] collaboration. After 1.7 seconds, it was observed as the [[gamma ray burst]] GRB 170817A by the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] and [[INTEGRAL]], and its optical counterpart SSS17a was detected 11 hours later at the [[Las Campanas Observatory]], then by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and the [[Dark Energy Camera]]. Ultraviolet observations by the [[Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory]], X-ray observations by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and [[Radio astronomy|radio]] observations by the [[Very Large Array|Karl G.

In [[gravitational wave astronomy]], a '''golden binary''' is a [[binary black hole]] collision event whose inspiral and ringdown phases have been measured accurately enough to provide separate measurements of the initial and final black hole masses.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nakano/&gt;

==Testing general relativity==

Current [[LIGO]]/[[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] protocol relies on its library of several hundred thousand precomputed templates of black hole collisions conceivably detectable in their frequency range.  A putative binary black hole collision signal consists of inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases.  The complete signal is compared with the template library, and event parameters and significance are based on an analysis of such matches.

This allows for self-consistency checks of [[general relativity]].  In order to test certain [[Alternatives to general relativity|competing theories of gravity]], one faces the problem that only general relativity has been studied enough that the complete merger phase is known.  Therefore, only a signal that can be matched separately in the inspiral and ringdown phases can be used to allow or contradict such theories.

==Identified golden binaries==
[[GW150914]] was a golden binary, indeed, this led to additional internal checks done by LIGO.&lt;ref name=Ghosh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt;  [[GW151226]] and LVT151012 were not.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt;

'''Astronomy''' (from {{lang-el|ἀστρονομία}}) is a [[natural science]] that studies [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[celestial event|phenomena]]. It uses [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] in order to explain their origin and [[chronology of the Universe|evolution]]. Objects of interest include [[planets]], [[natural satellite|moons]], [[star]]s, [[nebulae]], [[galaxy|galaxies]], and [[comet]]s. Relevant phenomena include [[supernova]] explosions, [[gamma ray burst]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[blazar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates outside [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. [[Cosmology]] is a branch of astronomy. It studies the [[Universe]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unsöld|first1=Albrecht|last2=Baschek|first2=Bodo|title=Classical Astronomy and the Solar System – Introduction|date=2001|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in [[recorded history]] made methodical observations of the [[night sky]]. These include the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonians]], [[Greek astronomy|Greeks]], [[Indian astronomy|Indians]], [[Egyptian astronomy|Egyptians]], [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and many ancient [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as [[astrometry]], [[celestial navigation]], [[observational astronomy]], and the making of [[calendar]]s. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unsöld|first1=Albrecht|last2=Baschek|first2=Bodo|title=Classical Astronomy and the Solar System|date=2001|pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional astronomy is split into [[observational astronomy|observational]] and [[theoretical astronomy|theoretical]] branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.

Amateurs play an [[citizen science|active role]] in astronomy. It is one of the few sciences in which this is the case. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of [[transient astronomical event|transient events]]. [[amateur astronomy|Amateur astronomers]] have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.

{{Main|History of astronomy}}
{{Further|Archaeoastronomy|List of astronomers}}

===Ancient times===

In early historic times, astronomy only consisted of the observation and predictions of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye. In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these [[Observatory|observatories]] could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Forbes, 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

Before tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in [[Babylonian astronomy|Mesopotamia]], [[Greek astronomy|Greece]], [[Astrology in medieval Islam|Persia]], [[Indian astronomy|India]], [[Chinese astronomy|China]], [[Egyptian astronomy|Egypt]], and [[Maya civilization|Central America]], astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the Universe began to develop. Most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as [[astrometry]]. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically.

===Middle Ages===

Medieval Europe housed a number of important astronomers. [[Richard of Wallingford]] (1292–1336) made major contributions to astronomy and horology, including the invention of the first astronomical clock, the [[Rectangulus]] which allowed for the measurement of angles between planets and other astronomical bodies, as well as an [[equatorium]] called the ''Albion'' which could be used for astronomical calculations such as [[moon|lunar]], [[sun|solar]] and [[planet]]ary [[longitude]]s and could predict [[eclipse]]s. [[Nicole Oresme]] (1320–1382) and [[Jean Buridan]] (1300–1361) first discussed evidence for the rotation of the Earth, furthermore, Buridan also developed the theory of impetus (predecessor of the modern scientific theory of [[inertia]]) which was able to show planets were capable of motion without the intervention of angels.&lt;ref&gt;Hannam, James. ''God's philosophers: how the medieval world laid the foundations of modern science''. Icon Books Ltd, 2009, 180&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg von Peuerbach]] (1423–1461) and [[Regiomontanus]] (1436–1476) helped make astronomical progress instrumental to Copernicus's development of the heliocentric model decades later.

[[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Astronomy flourished in the Islamic world]] and other parts of the world. This led to the emergence of the first astronomical [[Observatory|observatories]] in the [[Muslim world]] by the early 9th century.&lt;ref name="Kennedy-1962"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=Edward S. |date=1962 |title=Review: ''The Observatory in Islam and Its Place in the General History of the Observatory'' by Aydin Sayili |journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]] |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=237–39 |doi=10.1086/349558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Micheau-992-3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Micheau|first=Françoise|year=|editor-last=Rashed|editor-first=Roshdi|editor2-last=Morelon|editor2-first=Régis|title=The Scientific Institutions in the Medieval Near East|url=|journal=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science|volume=3|pages=992–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nas |first=Peter J|title=Urban Symbolism|date=1993 |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |isbn=978-90-04-09855-8|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 964, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], the largest [[galaxy]] in the [[Local Group]], was described by the Persian Muslim astronomer [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]] in his ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]''.&lt;ref name="NSOG"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kepple |first= George Robert |first2=Glen W. |last2=Sanner |title= The Night Sky Observer's Guide |volume= 1 |publisher= Willmann-Bell, Inc. |date= 1998 |isbn= 978-0-943396-58-3 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SN 1006]] [[supernova]], the brightest [[apparent magnitude]] stellar event in recorded history, was observed by the Egyptian Arabic astronomer [[Ali ibn Ridwan]] and [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] in 1006.

For over six centuries (from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment), the Roman Catholic Church gave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy than probably all other institutions. Among the Church's motives was finding the date for Easter.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Heilbron, ''The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar Observatories'' (1999) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific revolution===
[[File:Galileo moon phases.jpg|thumb|[[Galileo]]'s sketches and observations of the [[Moon]] revealed that the surface was mountainous.]]
[[File:Medieval Astronomy (f.4v).jpg|thumb|An astronomical chart from an early scientific manuscript, c. 1000]]
During the [[Renaissance]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system. His work was defended by [[Galileo Galilei]] and expanded upon by [[Johannes Kepler]]. Kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly described the details of the motion of the planets around the Sun. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 49–58&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Isaac Newton]], with his invention of [[celestial dynamics]] and his [[gravity|law of gravitation]], who finally explained the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the [[reflecting telescope]].&lt;ref name="f58-64"&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 58–64&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements in the size and quality of the telescope led to further discoveries. The English astronomer [[John Flamsteed]] catalogued over 3000 stars,&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1864) ''[[Chambers Book of Days]]''&lt;/ref&gt; More extensive star catalogues were produced by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]. The astronomer [[William Herschel]] made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet [[Uranus]], the first new planet found.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 79–81&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18–19th centuries, the study of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Alexis Claude Clairaut]], and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] and [[Pierre Simon Laplace]], allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology, including the [[spectroscope]] and [[Astrophotography|photography]]. [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide range of [[temperature]]s, [[mass]]es, and sizes.&lt;ref name="short history" /&gt;

The existence of the Earth's galaxy, the [[Milky Way]], as its own group of stars was only proved in the 20th century, along with the existence of "external" galaxies. The observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name=Belkora2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Belkora, Leila|title=Minding the heavens: the story of our discovery of the Milky Way|isbn=978-0-7503-0730-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qBM-wez94WwC&amp;printsec=frontcover|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|date=2003|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as [[black hole]]s and [[neutron star]]s, which have been used to explain such observed phenomena as [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[blazar]]s, and [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]]. [[Physical cosmology]] made huge advances during the 20th century. In the early 1900s the model of the [[Big Bang]] theory was formulated, heavily evidenced by [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], [[Hubble's law]], and the [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|cosmological abundances of elements]]. [[Space telescope]]s have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In February 2016, it was revealed that the [[LIGO]] project had [[first observation of gravitational waves|detected evidence]] of [[gravitational waves]] in the previous September.&lt;ref name="Discovery 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Einstein's gravitational waves found at last |journal=Nature News| url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361 |date=11 February 2016 |last=Castelvecchi |first=Davide |last2=Witze |first2=Witze |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19361 |accessdate=11 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Abbot'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger| authors=B.P.

==Observational astronomy==
{{Main|Observational astronomy}}

The main source of information about [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] and other objects is [[visible light]], or more generally [[electromagnetic radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html|title=Electromagnetic Spectrum|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905131651/http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html|archivedate=5 September 2006 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observational astronomy may be categorized according to the corresponding region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] on which the observations are made. Some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the Earth's surface, while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the Earth's atmosphere. Specific information on these subfields is given below.

===Radio astronomy===
[[File:USA.NM.VeryLargeArray.02.jpg|thumb|The [[Very Large Array]] in [[New Mexico]], an example of a [[radio telescope]]]]
{{Main|Radio astronomy}}
Radio astronomy uses radiation with [[wavelength]]s greater than approximately one millimeter, outside the visible range.&lt;ref name="cox2000"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-387-98746-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio astronomy is different from most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed [[radio wave]]s can be treated as [[wave]]s rather than as discrete [[photon]]s. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt;

Although some [[radio wave]]s are emitted directly by astronomical objects, a product of [[black-body radiation|thermal emission]], most of the radio emission that is observed is the result of [[synchrotron radiation]], which is produced when [[electron]]s orbit [[magnetic field]]s.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt; Additionally, a number of [[spectral line]]s produced by [[interstellar gas]], notably the [[hydrogen]] spectral line at 21&amp;nbsp;cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.&lt;ref name="shu1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt;

{{Main|Infrared astronomy}}
Infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of [[infrared]] radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, [[circumstellar disk]]s or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in [[molecular cloud]]s and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic [[protostar]]s and their host [[star clusters]].&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/|title=Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Mission|last=|first=|date=30 September 2014|publisher=[[NASA]] [[University of California, Berkeley]]|access-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ma2013&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 2013Ap&amp;SS.344..175M|title = Discovering protostars and their host clusters via WISE|last1 = Majaess|first1 = D.|journal = Astrophysics and Space Science|volume = 344|issue = 1|pages = 175–186|year = 2013|arxiv = 1211.4032|doi = 10.1007/s10509-012-1308-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the exception of infrared [[wavelengths]] close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|isbn=978-0-540-07465-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of observations were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 [[Ångstrom|Å]] to 7000 Å (400 [[nanometre|nm]] to 700&amp;nbsp;nm),&lt;ref name="moore1997"/&gt; that same equipment can be used to observe some [[near-ultraviolet]] and [[near-infrared]] radiation.

===Ultraviolet astronomy===
{{Main|Ultraviolet astronomy}}

Ultraviolet astronomy employs [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200&amp;nbsp;Å (10 to 320&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt; Light at those wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue [[star]]s ([[OB star]]s) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include [[planetary nebula]]e, [[supernova remnant]]s, and active galactic nuclei.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt; However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by [[interstellar dust]], an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt;

===X-ray astronomy===
{{Main|X-ray astronomy}}
[[File:B30727.jpg|thumb|X-ray jet made from a supermassive black hole found by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, made visible by light from the early Universe]]
X-ray astronomy uses [[X-radiation|X-ray wavelengths]]. Typically, X-ray radiation is produced by [[synchrotron emission]] (the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), [[bremsstrahlung radiation|thermal emission from thin gases]] above 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (10&amp;nbsp;million) [[kelvin]]s, and [[blackbody radiation|thermal emission from thick gases]] above 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Kelvin.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt; Since X-rays are absorbed by the [[Earth's atmosphere]], all X-ray observations must be performed from [[high-altitude balloon]]s, [[rocket]]s, or [[X-ray astronomy satellite]]s. Notable [[Astrophysical X-ray source|X-ray sources]] include [[X-ray binaries]], [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova remnant]]s, [[elliptical galaxies]], [[clusters of galaxies]], and [[active galactic nuclei]].&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt;

===Gamma-ray astronomy===
{{Main|Gamma ray astronomy}}
Gamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] or by specialized telescopes called [[atmospheric Cherenkov telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt; The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="spectrum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/frontiers/latest/feature.asp?article=14F1&amp;style=feature|title=The electromagnetic spectrum|last=Penston|first=Margaret J.|date=14 August 2002|publisher=Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120908014227/http://www.pparc.ac.uk/frontiers/latest/feature.asp?article=14F1&amp;style=feature|archive-date=8 September 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Gamma ray|gamma-ray]] emitting sources are actually [[gamma-ray burst]]s, objects which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]] candidates such as active galactic nuclei.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt;

===Fields not based on the electromagnetic spectrum===
In addition to electromagnetic radiation, a few other events originating from great distances may be observed from the Earth.

In [[neutrino astronomy]], astronomers use heavily shielded [[Neutrino observatory|underground facilities]] such as [[SAGE (ruSsian American Gallium Experiment)|SAGE]], [[GALLEX]], and [[Kamioka Observatory|Kamioka II/III]] for the detection of [[neutrino]]s. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the [[Sun]], but 24 neutrinos were also detected from [[supernova 1987A]].&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt; [[Cosmic ray]]s, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Gravitational-wave astronomy]] is an emerging field of astronomy that employs [[gravitational-wave detector]]s to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, such as the ''Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory'' [[LIGO]]. LIGO made its [[First observation of gravitational waves|first detection]] on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a [[binary black hole]].&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"&gt;{{cite journal | collaboration = LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |journal=[[Phys.

===Astrometry and celestial mechanics===
{{Main|Astrometry|Celestial mechanics}}
[[File:EmissionNebula NGC6357.jpg|thumb|Star cluster [[Pismis 24]] with a nebula]]
One of the oldest fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects. Historically, accurate knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in [[celestial navigation]] (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of [[calendar]]s.

Careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational [[Perturbation theory|perturbations]], and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as [[celestial mechanics]]. More recently the tracking of [[near-Earth object]]s will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Calvert|first = James B.|date = 28 March 2003|url = http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/orbits.htm|title = Celestial Mechanics|publisher = University of Denver|accessdate = 21 August 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907120741/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/orbits.htm|archivedate = 7 September 2006|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measurement of [[stellar parallax]] of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the [[cosmic distance ladder]] that is used to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the [[radial velocity]] and [[proper motion]] of stars allows astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated [[dark matter]] in the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~rjp0i/museum/engines.html|title=Hall of Precision Astrometry|publisher=[[University of Virginia]] Department of Astronomy|accessdate=17 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826104509/http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~rjp0i/museum/engines.html|archivedate=26 August 2006 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, the measurement of the [[stellar wobble]] of nearby stars was [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Astrometry|used to detect]] large [[extrasolar planet]]s orbiting those stars.&lt;ref name="Wolszczan"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Wolszczan, A.| author2=Frail, D.

==Theoretical astronomy==
{{Nucleosynthesis}}
{{Main|Theoretical astronomy}}
Theoretical astronomers use several tools including [[mathematical model|analytical models]] and [[computation]]al [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulations]]; each has its particular advantages. Analytical models of a process are better for giving broader insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models reveal the existence of phenomena and effects otherwise unobserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=H.|last=Roth|title=A Slowly Contracting or Expanding Fluid Sphere and its Stability|journal=Physical Review |volume=39|issue=3|pages=525–29|date=1932|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.39.525|bibcode = 1932PhRv...39..525R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.S.|last=Eddington|title=Internal Constitution of the Stars|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1926|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hJW3JbhnFQMC&amp;pg=PA182|isbn=978-0-521-33708-3|pmid=17747682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists in astronomy endeavor to create theoretical models and from the results predict observational consequences of those models. The observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the phenomena.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Phenomena modeled by theoretical astronomers include: [[stellar dynamics]] and [[Stellar evolution|evolution]]; [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy formation]]; [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale distribution]] of [[matter]] in the [[Universe]]; origin of [[cosmic ray]]s; [[general relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]], including [[string theory|string]] [[cosmology]] and [[astroparticle physics]]. Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for [[black hole]] (''astro'')[[physics]] and the study of [[gravitational waves]].

Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy, now included in the [[Lambda-CDM model]] are the [[Big Bang]], [[dark matter]] and fundamental theories of [[physics]].

Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, ''astrophysicists'' typically apply many disciplines of physics, including [[mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]], [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]], and [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics|atomic and molecular physics]].

In practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties of [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], and [[black holes]]; whether or not [[time travel]] is possible, [[wormhole]]s can form, or the [[multiverse]] exists; and the [[Cosmogony|origin]] and [[ultimate fate of the universe]].&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt; Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|Solar System formation and evolution]]; [[stellar dynamics]] and [[Stellar evolution|evolution]]; [[galaxy formation and evolution]]; [[magnetohydrodynamics]]; [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] of [[matter]] in the universe; origin of [[cosmic ray]]s; [[general relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]], including [[string theory|string]] cosmology and [[astroparticle physics]].

===Astrochemistry===

[[Astrochemistry]] is the study of the abundance and reactions of [[molecule]]s in the [[Universe]], and their interaction with [[radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/amp-rg/astrochemistry|title=Astrochemistry|date=15 July 2013|newspaper=www.cfa.harvard.edu/|access-date=20 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120211934/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/amp-rg/astrochemistry|archive-date=20 November 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline is an overlap of astronomy and [[chemistry]]. The word "astrochemistry" may be applied to both the [[Solar System]] and the [[interstellar medium]]. The study of the abundance of elements and [[isotope]] ratios in Solar System objects, such as [[meteorite]]s, is also called [[cosmochemistry]], while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of [[molecular cloud|molecular gas clouds]] is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.

Studies in this field contribute to the understanding of the [[formation of the Solar System]], Earth's origin and geology, [[abiogenesis]], and the origin of climate and oceans.

===Astrobiology===

[[Astrobiology]] is an interdisciplinary scientific field concerned with the [[abiogenesis|origins]], [[Protocell|early evolution]], distribution, and future of [[life]] in the [[universe]]. Astrobiology considers the question of whether [[extraterrestrial life]] exists, and how humans can detect it if it does.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about-astrobiology/ |title=About Astrobiology |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=21 January 2008 |work=NASA Astrobiology Institute |publisher=NASA | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081011192341/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about-astrobiology/| archivedate= 11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''exobiology''' is similar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exobiology Mirriam Webster Dictionary entry "Exobiology"] (accessed 11 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrobiology makes use of [[molecular biology]], [[biophysics]], [[biochemistry]], [[chemistry]], astronomy, [[physical cosmology]], [[exoplanetology]] and [[geology]] to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize [[biosphere]]s that might be different from that on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life and death of planet Earth |last1=Ward |first1=P.D. |authorlink= |author2=Brownlee, D. |date=2004 |publisher=Owl Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8050-7512-0 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abiogenesis|The origin]] and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://link.springer.com/journal/11084 |title=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |work=Journal: Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |accessdate=6 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing [[Scientific method|scientific data]], and although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with [[hypotheses]] that fit firmly into existing [[Theory#Science|scientific theories]].

===Physical cosmology===
{{Nature timeline}}
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
[[Cosmology]] (from the Greek κόσμος (''kosmos'') "world, universe" and λόγος (''logos'') "word, study" or literally "logic") could be considered the study of the Universe as a whole.
[[File:Hubble Extreme Deep Field (full resolution).png|thumb|[[Hubble Extreme Deep Field]]]]

Observations of the [[large-scale structure of the Universe]], a branch known as [[physical cosmology]], have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the [[Big Bang]], wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] over the course of 13.8 billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; to its present condition.&lt;ref name=Dodelson2003/&gt; The concept of the Big Bang can be traced back to the discovery of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=Dodelson2003&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|title=Modern cosmology|date=2003|isbn=978-0-12-219141-1|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of this expansion, the Universe underwent several evolutionary stages. In the very early moments, it is theorized that the Universe experienced a very rapid [[cosmic inflation]], which homogenized the starting conditions. Thereafter, [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]] produced the elemental abundance of the early Universe.&lt;ref name=Dodelson2003/&gt; (See also [[nucleocosmochronology]].)

When the first neutral [[atom]]s formed from a sea of primordial ions, space became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation. The expanding Universe then underwent a Dark Age due to the lack of stellar energy sources.&lt;ref name="cosmology 101"&gt;{{cite web|last = Hinshaw|first = Gary|date = 13 July 2006|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni.html|title = Cosmology 101: The Study of the Universe|publisher = NASA WMAP|accessdate =10 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060813053535/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni.html| archivedate= 13 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hierarchical structure of matter began to form from minute variations in the mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the [[Population III stars]]. These massive stars triggered the [[reionization]] process and are believed to have created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.&lt;ref&gt;Dodelson, 2003, pp. 216–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravitational aggregations clustered into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, organizations of gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies. Over time, these pulled in more matter, and were often organized into [[Galaxy groups and clusters|groups and clusters]] of galaxies, then into larger-scale superclusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_lss.html|title = Galaxy Clusters and Large-Scale Structure|publisher = University of Cambridge|accessdate =8 September 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061010041120/http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_lss.html| archivedate= 10 October 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various fields of physics are crucial to studying the universe. Interdisciplinary studies involve the fields of [[quantum mechanics]], [[particle physics]], [[plasma physics]], [[condensed matter physics]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[optics]], and [[nuclear physics]].

Fundamental to the structure of the Universe is the existence of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Preuss|first = Paul|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/dark-energy.html|title = Dark Energy Fills the Cosmos|publisher = U.S. Department of Energy, Berkeley Lab|accessdate =8 September 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060811215815/http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/dark-energy.html| archivedate= 11 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extragalactic astronomy===

[[File:grav.lens1.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|This image shows several blue, loop-shaped objects that are multiple images of the same galaxy, duplicated by the [[gravitational lens]] effect of the cluster of yellow galaxies near the middle of the photograph.

{{Main|Extragalactic astronomy}}
The study of objects outside our galaxy is a branch of astronomy concerned with the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of Galaxies]], their morphology (description) and [[Galaxy morphological classification|classification]], the observation of [[Active galaxy|active galaxies]], and at a larger scale, the [[Galaxy groups and clusters|groups and clusters of galaxies]]. Finally, the latter is important for the understanding of the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]].

Most [[galaxy|galaxies]] are organized into distinct shapes that allow for classification schemes. They are commonly divided into [[spiral galaxy|spiral]], [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] and [[irregular galaxy|Irregular]] galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Keel|first = Bill|date = 1 August 2006|url=http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/classify.html|title = Galaxy Classification|publisher = University of Alabama|accessdate =8 September 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901074027/http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/classify.html| archivedate= 1 September 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name suggests, an elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of an [[ellipse]]. The stars move along [[randomness|random]] orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.

A spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the [[Milky Way]] and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], are spiral galaxies.

Irregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.

An active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.

A [[radio galaxy]] is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas.

The [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]] is represented by groups and clusters of galaxies. This structure is organized into a hierarchy of groupings, with the largest being the [[supercluster]]s.

===Galactic astronomy===

[[File:Milky Way Spiral Arm.svg|right|thumb|Observed structure of the [[Milky Way]]'s spiral arms]]
{{Main|Galactic astronomy}}
The [[Solar System]] orbits within the [[Milky Way]], a [[barred spiral galaxy]] that is a prominent member of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.

In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a [[supermassive black hole]] at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, [[Stellar population|population I]] stars. The disk is surrounded by a [[Galactic spheroid|spheroid halo]] of older, [[population II]] stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as [[globular cluster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/GC/index.php|title=The Galactic Centre|last=Ott|first=Thomas|date=24 August 2006|publisher=Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik|accessdate=17 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904140550/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/GC/index.php|archivedate=4 September 2006 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the stars lies the [[interstellar medium]], a region of sparse matter. In the densest regions, [[molecular cloud]]s of [[Hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]] and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact [[pre-stellar core]] or [[dark nebula]]e, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the [[Jeans length]]) to form compact protostars.&lt;ref name=Smith2004&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael David|last=Smith|date=2004| pages=53–86|title=The Origin of Stars|chapter=Cloud formation, Evolution and Destruction| publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=978-1-86094-501-4 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=UVgBoqZg8a4C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the more massive stars appear, they transform the cloud into an [[H II region]] (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The [[Solar wind|stellar wind]] and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind one or more young [[open cluster]]s of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael David|last=Smith|date=2004| pages=185–99|title=The Origin of Stars|chapter=Massive stars

Kinematic studies of matter in the Milky Way and other galaxies have demonstrated that there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A [[dark matter halo]] appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Van den Bergh, Sidney|title=The Early History of Dark Matter|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=1999|volume=111|issue=760|pages=657–60|doi=10.1086/316369|arxiv = astro-ph/9904251 |bibcode = 1999PASP..111..657V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Star}}
The study of stars and [[stellar evolution]] is fundamental to our understanding of the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior.&lt;ref name=Amos7&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 7–18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Star formation]] occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as [[Dark nebula|giant molecular clouds]]. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a [[protostar]]. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger [[nuclear fusion]], thus creating a [[main-sequence star]].&lt;ref name=Smith2004/&gt;

Almost all elements heavier than [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] were [[nucleosynthesis|created]] inside the cores of stars.&lt;ref name=Amos7/&gt;

The characteristics of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core. Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to [[Stellar evolution|evolve]]. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature. A star with a high enough core temperature will push its outer layers outward while increasing its core density. The resulting [[red giant]] formed by the expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.&lt;ref name=Amos&gt;Harpaz, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The final fate of the star depends on its mass, with stars of mass greater than about eight times the Sun becoming core collapse [[supernova]]e;&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 173–78&lt;/ref&gt; while smaller stars blow off their outer layers and leave behind the inert core in the form of a [[white dwarf]]. The ejection of the outer layers forms a [[planetary nebula]].&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 111–18&lt;/ref&gt; The remnant of a supernova is a dense [[neutron star]], or, if the stellar mass was at least three times that of the Sun, a [[black hole]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge atlas"&gt;{{cite book|editor= Audouze, Jean|editor2= Israel, Guy|title=The Cambridge Atlas of Astronomy|edition=3rd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1994|isbn=978-0-521-43438-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely orbiting binary stars can follow more complex evolutionary paths, such as mass transfer onto a white dwarf companion that can potentially cause a supernova.&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 189–210&lt;/ref&gt; Planetary nebulae and supernovae distribute the "[[metallicity|metals]]" produced in the star by fusion to the interstellar medium; without them, all new stars (and their planetary systems) would be formed from hydrogen and helium alone.&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 245–56&lt;/ref&gt;

At a distance of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the [[Sun]], a typical main-sequence [[dwarf star]] of [[stellar class]] G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a [[variable star]], but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the [[sunspot cycle]]. This is an 11-year oscillation in [[Wolf number|sunspot number]]. Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity.&lt;ref name="solar FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-solar.html|title=The Solar FAQ|last=Johansson|first=Sverker|authorlink=Sverker Johansson|date=27 July 2003|publisher=Talk.Origins Archive|accessdate=11 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907235636/http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-solar.html|archivedate=7 September 2006 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sun has steadily increased in luminosity by 40% since it first became a main-sequence star. The Sun has also undergone periodic changes in luminosity that can have a significant impact on the Earth.&lt;ref name="Environmental issues : essential primary sources."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v3=1&amp;DB=local&amp;CMD=010a+2006000857&amp;CNT=10+records+per+page|title=Environmental issues : essential primary sources|last=Lerner|first=K.

The visible outer surface of the Sun is called the [[photosphere]]. Above this layer is a thin region known as the [[chromosphere]]. This is surrounded by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated [[solar corona|corona]].

At the center of the Sun is the core region, a volume of sufficient temperature and pressure for [[nuclear fusion]] to occur. Above the core is the [[radiation zone]], where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the [[convection zone]] where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.&lt;ref name="solar FAQ" /&gt;

A solar wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the Sun until, at the outermost limit of the Solar System, it reaches the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]]. As the solar wind passes the Earth, it interacts with the [[Earth's magnetic field]] ([[magnetosphere]]) and deflects the solar wind, but traps some creating the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s that envelop the Earth. The [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] are created when solar wind particles are guided by the magnetic flux lines into the Earth's polar regions where the lines then descend into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Stern, D.P.|author2 = Peredo, M.|date = 28 September 2004|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Intro.html|title = The Exploration of the Earth's Magnetosphere|publisher = NASA|accessdate =22 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060824003619/http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Intro.html| archivedate= 24 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planetary science is the study of the assemblage of [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[dwarf planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[asteroid]]s, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as extrasolar planets. The [[Solar System]] has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of the Sun's planetary system, although many new discoveries are still being made.&lt;ref name="geology"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://marswatch.tn.cornell.edu/rsm.html|title=Remote Sensing for the Earth Sciences: Manual of Remote Sensing|date=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|edition=3rd|author=Bell III, J.

The Solar System is subdivided into the inner planets, the [[asteroid belt]], and the outer planets. The inner [[terrestrial planet]]s consist of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], Earth, and [[Mars]]. The outer [[gas giant]] planets are [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name="planets"&gt;{{cite web|author = Grayzeck, E.|author2 = Williams, D.R.| date = 11 May 2006|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/|title = Lunar and Planetary Science|publisher = NASA|accessdate =21 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060820173205/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/| archivedate= 20 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond Neptune lies the [[Kuiper belt]], and finally the [[Oort Cloud]], which may extend as far as a light-year.

The planets were formed 4.6 billion years ago in the [[protoplanetary disk]] that surrounded the early Sun. Through a process that included gravitational attraction, collision, and accretion, the disk formed clumps of matter that, with time, became protoplanets. The [[radiation pressure]] of the [[solar wind]] then expelled most of the unaccreted matter, and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere. The planets continued to sweep up, or eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment, evidenced by the many [[impact crater]]s on the Moon. During this period, some of the protoplanets may have collided and one such collision may have [[giant impact hypothesis|formed the Moon]].&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montmerle|first=Thierry|author2=Augereau, Jean-Charles|author3= Chaussidon, Marc|title=Solar System Formation and Early Evolution: the First 100 Million Years|journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets|volume=98|issue=1–4|pages=39–95|date=2006|doi=10.1007/s11038-006-9087-5| bibcode=2006EM&amp;P...98...39M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a planet reaches sufficient mass, the materials of different densities segregate within, during [[planetary differentiation]]. This process can form a stony or metallic core, surrounded by a mantle and an outer crust. The core may include solid and liquid regions, and some planetary cores generate their own [[magnetic field]], which can protect their atmospheres from solar wind stripping.&lt;ref&gt;Montmerle, 2006, pp. 87–90&lt;/ref&gt;

A planet or moon's interior heat is produced from the collisions that created the body, by the decay of radioactive materials (''e.g.'' [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and [[Aluminium#Isotopes|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]]), or [[tidal acceleration|tidal heating]] caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as [[volcanism]] and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an [[atmosphere]] can also undergo surface [[erosion]] from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases with the exception of impact cratering.&lt;ref name="new solar system"&gt;{{cite book| editor=Beatty, J.K.| editor2=Petersen, C.C.| editor3=Chaikin, A.|title=The New Solar System|publisher=Cambridge press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iOezyHMVAMcC&amp;pg=PA70|page=70edition = 4th|date=1999|isbn =978-0-521-64587-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary studies==
Astronomy and astrophysics have developed significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. [[Archaeoastronomy]] is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] evidence. [[Astrobiology]] is the study of the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. [[Astrostatistics]] is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.

The study of [[chemical]]s found in space, including their formation, interaction and destruction, is called [[astrochemistry]]. These substances are usually found in [[molecular cloud]]s, although they may also appear in low temperature stars, brown dwarfs and planets. [[Cosmochemistry]] is the study of the chemicals found within the Solar System, including the origins of the elements and variations in the [[isotope]] ratios. Both of these fields represent an overlap of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry. As "[[forensic astronomy]]", finally, methods from astronomy have been used to solve problems of law and history.

==Amateur astronomy==
[[File:Telescope trailer 22.jpg|upright|thumb|Amateur astronomers can build their own equipment, and hold star parties and gatherings, such as [[Stellafane]].]]
{{Main|Amateur astronomy}}

Astronomy is one of the sciences to which amateurs can contribute the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with [[Amateur telescope making|equipment that they build themselves]]. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, [[meteor shower]]s, and a variety of [[deep-sky object]]s such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur [[astrophotography]], involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsmeteors.org/|title = The American Meteor Society|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060822135040/http://www.amsmeteors.org/| archivedate= 22 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jerry|last=Lodriguss|url=http://www.astropix.com/|title = Catching the Light: Astrophotography|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901185541/http://www.astropix.com/| archivedate= 1 September 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]], who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (''e.g.'' the [[One-Mile Telescope]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ghigo, F.|date = 7 February 2006|url=http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_jansky.shtml|title = Karl Jansky and the Discovery of Cosmic Radio Waves|publisher = National Radio Astronomy Observatory|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060831105945/http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_jansky.shtml| archivedate= 31 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~arcus/cara/|title = Cambridge Amateur Radio Astronomers|accessdate =24 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur astronomers continue to make scientific contributions to the field of astronomy and it is one of the few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars.

RGZ has published five scientific studies (May 2018).

i) '''Radio Galaxy Zoo: host galaxies and radio morphologies derived from visual inspection.''' (November 2015)&lt;ref name=RGZ_2/&gt;&lt;ref name=PhysOrg_1&gt;{{cite web| title=Volunteer black hole hunters as good as the experts| url=https://phys.org/news/2015-09-volunteer-black-hole-hunters-good.html#nRlv| publisher=Phys.org| date=7 September 2015| access-date=24 March 2018| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529135046/http://phys.org/news/2015-09-volunteer-black-hole-hunters-good.html#nRlv| archivedate=29 May 2016| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abstract begins: "We present results from the first twelve months of operation of Radio Galaxy Zoo, which upon completion will enable visual inspection of over 170,000 radio sources to determine the host galaxy of the radio emission and the radio morphology."&lt;ref name=RGZ_2/&gt; It then explains that RGZ "uses 1.4GHz radio images from both the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) in combination with mid-infrared images at 3.4μm from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and at 3.6μm from the Spitzer Space Telescope."&lt;ref name=RGZ_2/&gt; Its aims are that when complete, RGZ will measure the relative populations and properties of host galaxies; processes that might also provide an avenue for finding radio structures that are rare and extreme.&lt;ref name=RGZ_2/&gt;

On the [[International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research]] (ICRAR) website, an article from September 2015 named "Volunteer black hole hunters as good as the experts" explains how citizen scientists are as good as professionals at RGZ's tasks.&lt;ref name=VBH&gt;{{cite web| title=Volunteer black hole hunters as good as the experts| author=ICRAR journalist| url=https://www.icrar.org/volunteer-black-hole-hunters-as-good-as-the-experts| publisher=International Centre For Radio Astronomy| date=7 September 2015| access-date=16 March 2018| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325223724/https://www.icrar.org/volunteer-black-hole-hunters-as-good-as-the-experts| archivedate=25 March 2018| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research team tested trained citizen scientists and ten professional astronomers using a hundred images to help quantify the quality of the data gathered. As the initial results were published, facts and figures from RGZ became available. More than 1.2 million radio images have been looked at, which enabled 60,000 radio sources to be matched to their host galaxies: "A feat that would have taken a single astronomer working 40 hours a week roughly 50 years to complete."&lt;ref name=VBH/&gt;

(May 2016)&lt;ref name=RGZ_1&gt;{{cite journal| title=Radio Galaxy Zoo: discovery of a poor cluster through a giant wide-angle tail radio galaxy| author1=J.K. Banfield| author2=H.

The abstract begins: "We have discovered a previously unreported [[Supercluster|poor cluster]] of galaxies (RGZ-CL J0823.2+0333) through an unusual giant wide-angle tail radio galaxy found in the Radio Galaxy Zoo project." It continues to explain that the analysis of 2MASX J08231289+0333016's surrounding environment indicates that it is within a poor cluster. Radio morphology suggests that, firstly, "the host galaxy is moving at a significant velocity with respect to an ambient medium like that of at least a poor cluster" and secondly that "the source may have had two ignition events of the [[active galactic nucleus]] with 10^7yrs in between."&lt;ref name=RGZ_1/&gt; These suggestions reinforce the idea that there is an association between RGZ J082312.9+033301 and the newly-discovered poor cluster.&lt;ref name=RGZ_1/&gt;

On [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] website in an article "How citizen scientists discovered a giant cluster of galaxies", Ray Norris writes about the above study.&lt;ref name=HCS&gt;{{cite web| title=How citizen scientists discovered a giant cluster of galaxies| author=Ray Norris| url=https://theconversation.com/how-citizen-scientists-discovered-a-giant-cluster-of-galaxies-59373| publisher=The Conversation Trust (UK) Limited| date=13 June 2016| access-date=16 March 2016| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615120235/http://theconversation.com/how-citizen-scientists-discovered-a-giant-cluster-of-galaxies-59373| archivedate=15 June 2016| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that two Russian citizen scientists (CSs), Ivan Terentev and Tim Matorny, were participating in RGZ when they noticed something odd with one of the radio sources. It became clear that the radio source the two CSs had found "was just one of a line of radio blobs that delineate a C-shaped “wide angle tail galaxy” (WATG)." Lead scientist Julie Banfield explained that this was "something that none of us had even thought would be possible."&lt;ref name=HCS/&gt;

WATGs are rare objects that are formed when jets of electrons from [[black holes]], usually seen to be straight, are bent into a C shape by [[intergalactic gas]]. This characteristic shape is "a sure sign that there is intergalactic gas, signifying a cluster of galaxies, the largest known objects in the universe."&lt;ref name=HCS/&gt; The WATG discovered by Terentev and Matorny is one of the largest known and has led to the cluster being named after them. "This cluster, more than a billion light years away, contains at least 40 galaxies, marking an intersection of the sheets and filaments of the cosmic web that make up our universe."&lt;ref name=HCS/&gt; Clusters, despite their importance, are hard to find but the use of WATGs might be a way of finding more: However WATGs are rare.

On the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] website, Matorny and Terentev commented on their discovery. “I am still amazed and feel more motivated to look for stunning new radio galaxies,” Matorny said.&lt;ref name=NRAO_Tip&gt;{{cite web| title=Citizen Scientists' Discovery Points to Unknown Galaxy Cluster| url=https://public.nrao.edu/news/media-tip-sheet-july-2016/#item1| publisher=[[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]]| date=1 July 2016| access-date=24 March 2018| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912021145/https://public.nrao.edu/news/media-tip-sheet-july-2016/#item1| archivedate=12 September 2017| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terentev added, “I got a chance to see the whole process of science … and I have been a part of it!”&lt;ref name=NRAO_Tip/&gt;

iii) '''Radio Galaxy Zoo: A Search for Hybrid Morphology Radio Galaxies.''' (December 2017)&lt;ref name=HMG&gt;{{cite journal| title=Radio Galaxy Zoo: A Search for Hybrid Morphology Radio Galaxies| author1=A.D. Kapinska| author2=I. Terentev| author3=O.I. Wong| author4=S.S.

The abstract begins: "Hybrid morphology radio sources are a rare type of radio galaxy that display different Fanaroff-Riley classes on opposite sides of their nuclei." The authors explain that RGZ has enabled them to discover 25 new candidate hybrid morphology radio galaxies (HyMoRS). These HyMoRS are at distances between redshifts z=0.14 and 1.0. Nine of the host galaxies have previous [[spectrum|spectra]] and include [[quasars]] and  a rare [[Green bean galaxy]]. It states: "Although the origin of the hybrid morphology radio galaxies is still unclear, this type of radio source starts depicting itself as a rather diverse class."&lt;ref name=HMG/&gt; The abstract ends:"While high angular resolution follow-up observations are still necessary to confirm our candidates, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Radio Galaxy Zoo in the pre-selection of these sources from all-sky radio surveys, and report the reliability of citizen scientists in identifying and classifying complex radio sources."&lt;ref name=HMG/&gt;

In an article on the [[ARC Centre of Excellence for All-Sky Astrophysics]] CAASTRO website named "Citizen scientists bag a bunch of 'two-faced' galaxies", the author explains the findings of the above study.&lt;ref name=CSB&gt;{{cite web| title=Citizen scientists bag a bunch of 'two-faced' galaxies| author=Arc Centre of Excellence For All-Sky Astrophysics journalist| url=http://www.caastro.org/news/2017-hymors| publisher=Australian Government| date=27 November 2017| access-date=16 March 2018| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325223723/http://www.caastro.org/news/2017-hymors| archivedate=25 March 2018| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead scientist is Anna Kapinska with CS Ivan Terentev named second. Kapinska's team have been looking for rare types of galaxies named Hybrid Morphology Radio Galaxies (HyMoRS). These show galaxy characteristics that are combined, rather than distinct. The article states: "Finding more HyMoRS helps us understand what kind of galaxy can turn out this way, and what gives them their unusual properties. Knowing that, in turn, helps us better understand how all galaxies evolve."&lt;ref name=CSB/&gt;

The first recognised HyMoRS was discovered in 2002 and since then 30 more. RGZ near doubled the discoveries by adding 25 more. Galaxies with black holes that produce jets are often "divided into two classes, Fanaroff-Riley I and Fanaroff-Riley II (or FR I and II). FR I galaxies have jets that fade away as they extend outwards, while FR II galaxies have jets that end in a bright, strongly-emitting region (a ‘hotspot’)."&lt;ref name=CSB/&gt; Explanations include the behaviour of the central black hole, different densities of matter in the surrounding environment or simply illusions because of different distances.&lt;ref name=CSB/&gt;

iv) '''Radio Galaxy Zoo: Cosmological Alignment of Radio Sources''' (November 2017)&lt;ref name=CARS&gt;{{cite journal| title=Radio Galaxy Zoo: Cosmological Alignment of Radio Sources| author1=O.

[[File:GMRT antenna at sunset.jpg| thumb| [[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]]]]

In November 2017, a team lead by Omar Contigiani published a paper in [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] studying the mutual alignment of radio sources.&lt;ref name=CARS/&gt; Using data drawn from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS), they investigate the most powerful radio sources, namely the largest elliptical galaxies emitting plasma-filled jets. The abstract begins: "We study the mutual alignment of radio sources within two surveys, FIRST and TGSS. This is done by producing two position angle catalogues containing the preferential directions of respectively 30059 and 11674 extended sources distributed over more than 7000 and 17000 square degrees."&lt;ref name=CARS/&gt; The FIRST sample sources were identified by participants in RGZ, while the TGSS sample was the result of an automated process. Marginal evidence of local alignment is found in the FIRST sample, which has a 2% probability of being by chance. This supports other recent research by scientists using the [[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]]. The abstract ends: "The TGSS sample is found to be too sparsely populated to manifest a similar signal." Results suggest that there is a relative alignment present at cosmological distances.&lt;ref name=CARS/&gt;

v) '''Radio Galaxy Zoo: Compact and extended radio source classification with deep learning''' (May 2018).&lt;ref name=RGZ_Deep&gt;{{cite journal| title=Radio Galaxy Zoo: Compact and extended radio source classification with deep learning| author1=V.

In May 2018, Lukic and team published a study in [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] concerning machine learning techniques.

A '''constellation''' is an area on the [[celestial sphere]] in which a group of visible [[star]]s forms a perceived outline or pattern, typically representing an animal, mythological person or creature, or an inanimate object.&lt;ref name="oxforddic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/constellation |title=Definition of constellation |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the earliest constellations likely go back to [[prehistory]]. People used them to relate stories of their beliefs, experiences, [[creation myth|creation]], or [[mythology]]. Different cultures and countries adopted their own constellations, some of which lasted into the early [[20th century]] before today's constellations were internationally recognized. The recognition of constellations has changed significantly over time. Many have changed in size or shape. Some became popular, only to drop into obscurity. Others were limited to a single culture or nation.

The 48 traditional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in [[Aratus]]' work ''Phenomena'' and [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'', though their origin probably predates these works by several centuries. Constellations in the far [[southern celestial hemisphere|southern sky]] were added from the [[15th century]] until the mid-[[18th century]] when European explorers began traveling to the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Twelve ancient constellations belong to the [[zodiac]] (straddling the [[ecliptic]], which the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planet]]s all traverse). The origins of the zodiac remain historically uncertain; its [[astrology|astrological]] divisions became prominent [[circa|c.]] 400 BC in [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian]] or [[Chaldea]]n astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Britton |first=John P. |date=2010 |title=Studies in Babylonian lunar theory: part III. The introduction of the uniform zodiac |journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=617–63 |jstor=41134332 |doi=10.1007/S00407-010-0064-Z |access-date= |quote=[T]he zodiac was introduced between −408 and −397 and probably within a very few years of −400.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) formally accepted the modern list of [[IAU designated constellations|88 constellations]], and in 1928 adopted official constellation boundaries that together cover the entire celestial sphere.&lt;ref name="IAU1928"&gt;{{cite book |first=Eugène |last=Delporte |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |title=Délimitation scientifique des constellations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=v3XvAAAAMAAJ |year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title=Star Tales: The final 88 |first=Ian |last=Ridpath |year=2018|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1d.htm#delporte}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any given point in a [[celestial coordinate system]] lies in one of the modern constellations. Some [[stellar designation|astronomical naming systems]] include the constellation where a given celestial object is found to convey its approximate location in the sky. The [[Flamsteed designation]] of a star, for example, consists of a number and the genitive form of the constellation name.

Other star patterns or groups called [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] are not constellations per se, but are used by observers to navigate the night sky. Asterisms may be several stars within a constellation, or they may share stars with more than one constellation. Examples of asterisms include the [[Pleiades]] and [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] within the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and the [[False Cross]] split between the southern constellations [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]], or Venus' Mirror in the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].&lt;ref name="DOCdb2018"&gt;{{cite web

==Terminology==

The word "constellation" comes from the [[Late Latin]] term {{lang|la|cōnstellātiō}}, which can be translated as "set of stars"; it came into use in [[Middle English|English]] during the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/constellation#etymonline_v_18252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greek]] word for constellation is [[wikt:ἄστρον|ἄστρον.]] These terms generally referred to a recognisable pattern of stars whose appearance is associated with mythological characters or creatures, earthbound animals, or objects.&lt;ref name="oxforddic" /&gt; A more modern astronomical sense of the term "constellation" denotes one of the 88 [[IAU designated constellations]] recognized today.&lt;ref name="oxforddicastro"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095633860 |title=Constellation |work=Oxford Dictionary of Astronomy |access-date=26 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colloquial usage does not draw a sharp distinction between "constellations" and smaller "asterisms" (pattern of stars), yet the modern accepted astronomical constellations employ such a distinction. E.g., the [[Pleiades]] and the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] are both asterisms, and each lies within the boundaries of the constellation of Taurus. Another example is the northern asterism popularly known as the [[Big Dipper]] (US) or the Plough (UK), composed of the seven brightest stars within the area of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]-defined constellation of [[Ursa Major]]. The southern [[False Cross]] asterism includes portions of the constellations [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] and the [[Summer Triangle]] is composed of the brightest stars in the constellations [[Lyra (constellation)|Lyra]], [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] and [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].

A constellation (or star), viewed from a particular latitude on [[Earth]], that never sets below the [[horizon]] is termed [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]]. From the [[North Pole]] or [[South Pole]], all constellations south or north of the [[celestial equator]] are [[circumpolar constellation|circumpolar]]. Depending on the definition, equatorial constellations may include those that lie between declinations 45° north and 45° south,&lt;ref name=harbord_goodwin1897/&gt; or those that pass through the declination range of the ecliptic or [[zodiac]] ranging between 23½° north, the celestial equator, and 23½° south.&lt;ref name="Norton14th" /&gt;&lt;ref name=steele1884 /&gt;

Stars in constellations can appear near each other in the sky, but they usually lie at a variety of distances away from the Earth. Since each star has its own independent motion, all constellations will change slowly over time. After tens to hundreds of thousands of years, familiar outlines will become unrecognizable.&lt;ref name="marc"&gt;{{cite web

== Identification ==

Both the 88  [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] recognized constellations and those that cultures have recognized throughout history are essentially imagined figures and shapes with only a certain basis in the actually observable sky.&lt;ref&gt;''What Are the Constellations?'', University of Wisconsin, http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many officially recognized constellations are based in the imaginations of ancient, Near Eastern and Mediterranean mythologies, but the physical reality of the Earth's position in the Milky Way still produces shapes that are connected by the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nautil.us/blog/forest-for-the-treeswhy-we-recognize-faces--constellations |title=Forest for the Trees – Why We Recognize Faces &amp; Constellations|date=19 May 2014|publisher=Nautilus Magazine |access-date=3 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Orion's Belt]] forms a more or less visually perfect line. [[H.A. Rey]], who wrote popular books on astronomy, pointed out the imaginative nature of the constellations and their mythological, artistic basis, and the practical use of identifying them through definite images, according to the classical names they were given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rey |first=H.A. |date=1954 |title=The Stars: A New Way to See Them |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing |isbn=978-0547132808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the early constellations ==

=== Lascaux Caves Southern France ===
It has been suggested that the 17,000-year-old [[cave painting]]s in [[Lascaux]] Southern France depict star constellations such as Taurus, Orion's Belt and the Pleiades.  However, this view is not yet generally accepted among scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1997ascu.conf..217R |title=The Pleiades in the "Salle des Taureaux", grotte de Lascaux.

=== Mesopotamia ===
Inscribed stones and clay writing tablets from [[Mesopotamia]] (in modern Iraq) dating to 3000 BC provide the earliest generally accepted evidence for humankind's identification of constellations.&lt;ref name= Rogers&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1998JBAA..108....9R|title=Origins of the ancient constellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions|journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association|volume=108|page=9|last1=Rogers|first1=J. H|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the bulk of the Mesopotamian constellations were created within a relatively short interval from around 1300 to 1000 BC. Mesopotamian constellations appeared later in many of the classical Greek constellations.&lt;ref name="Greek Constellations 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaefer|first1=Bradley E.|authorlink=Bradley E.

The oldest [[Babylonian star catalogues|Babylonian catalogues]] of stars and constellations date back to the beginning of the [[Middle Bronze Age]], most notably the ''Three Stars Each'' texts and the ''[[MUL.APIN]]'', an expanded and revised version based on more accurate observation from around 1000 BC. However, the numerous [[Sumerian language|Sumerian names]] in these catalogues suggest that they built on older, but otherwise unattested, [[Sumer]]ian traditions of the [[Early Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.westnet.com.au/Gary-David-Thompson/page11-4.html |title=History of the Constellations and Star Names – D.4: Sumerian constellations and star names? |work=Gary D.

The classical Zodiac is a revision of [[Neo-Babylonian]] constellations from the 6th century BC. The Greeks adopted the Babylonian constellations in the 4th century BC. Twenty Ptolemaic constellations are from the Ancient Near East. Another ten have the same stars but different names.&lt;ref name="Greek Constellations 2006"/&gt;

Biblical scholar [[E. W. Bullinger]] interpreted some of the creatures mentioned in the books of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] as the middle signs of the four quarters of the Zodiac,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E.

=== Classical antiquity ===
{{See also||Egyptian astronomy|Ancient Greek astronomy}}
[[File:Senenmut.jpg|upright|thumb|Ancient Egyptian star chart and decanal clock on the ceiling from the tomb of Senenmut]]
There is only limited information on ancient Greek constellations{{fact|date=April 2020}}, with some fragmentary evidence being found in the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of the Greek poet [[Hesiod]], who mentioned the "heavenly bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Stars and Constellations in Homer and Hesiod |journal=The Annual of the British School at Athens |volume=46 |pages=86–101 |date=1951|doi=10.1017/S0068245400018359 |last1=Lorimer |first1=H. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek astronomy essentially adopted the older Babylonian system in the [[Hellenistic era]]{{fact|date=April 2020}}, first introduced to Greece by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] in the 4th century BC. The original work of Eudoxus is lost, but it survives as a versification by [[Aratus]], dating to the 3rd century BC. The most complete existing works dealing with the mythical origins of the constellations are by the Hellenistic writer termed [[pseudo-Eratosthenes]] and an early Roman writer styled pseudo-[[Hyginus]]. The basis of Western astronomy as taught during [[Late Antiquity]] and until the [[Early Modern period]] is the ''[[Almagest]]'' by [[Ptolemy]], written in the 2nd century.

In the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], [[Egyptian astronomy|native Egyptian]] tradition of anthropomorphic figures represented the planets, stars, and various constellations.&lt;ref name="Marshall Clagett 1995, p. 111"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Clagett|title=Ancient Egyptian Science: Calendars, clocks, and astronomy|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8c10QYoGa4UC|year=1989|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-214-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were combined with Greek and Babylonian astronomical systems culminating in the [[Dendera zodiac|Zodiac of Dendera]]; it remains unclear when this occurred, but most were placed during the Roman period between 2nd to 4th centuries AD. The oldest known depiction of the zodiac showing all the now familiar constellations, along with some original Egyptian constellations, [[decans]], and [[planets]].&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Denderah|title=Zodiac of Dendera, epitome. (Exhib., Leic. square)|url= https://books.google.com/?id=xznqw5EkOCMC |year=1825}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' remained the standard definition of constellations in the medieval period both in Europe and in [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic astronomy]].

=== Ancient China ===
{{further|Chinese constellations|Chinese astronomy}}
[[File:Su Song Star Map 1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Chinese star map]] with a cylindrical projection ([[Su Song]])]]

[[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]] had a long tradition of observing celestial phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Needham|first = Joseph|volume = 3|page = 171|series=Science and Civilisation in China|title = Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1959|isbn =978-0521058018|url =https://books.google.com/?id=jfQ9E0u4pLAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonspecific [[Chinese star names]], later categorized in the [[twenty-eight mansions]], have been found on [[oracle bones]] from [[Anyang]], dating back to the middle [[Shang dynasty]]. These [[Chinese constellations|constellations]] are some of the most important observations of Chinese sky, attested from the 5th century BC. Parallels to the earliest Babylonian (Sumerian) star catalogues suggest that the ancient Chinese system did not arise independently.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite book|author1=Xiaochun Sun|author2=Jacob Kistemaker|title=The Chinese Sky During the Han: Constellating Stars and Society|url=https://books.google.com/?id=87lvBoFi8A0C |year=1997|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-10737-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three schools of classical [[Chinese astronomy]] in the [[Han period]] are attributed to astronomers of the earlier [[Warring States period]]. The constellations of the three schools were conflated into a single system by [[Chen Zhuo]], an astronomer of the 3rd century ([[Three Kingdoms period]]). Chen Zhuo's work has been lost, but information on his system of constellations survives in [[Tang period]] records, notably by [[Qutan Xida]]. The oldest extant Chinese star chart dates to that period and was preserved as part of the [[Dunhuang Manuscripts]]. Native Chinese astronomy flourished during the [[Song dynasty]], and during the [[Yuan dynasty]] became increasingly influenced by [[medieval Islamic astronomy]] (see [[Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era]]).&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; As maps were prepared during this period on more scientific lines, they were considered as more reliable.&lt;ref name="Selin2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Selin|first=Helaine Elise|title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kt9DIY1g9HYC&amp;pg=PA2022|date= 2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-4559-2|page=2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known map from the Song period is the [[Chinese star maps|Suzhou Astronomical Chart]], which was prepared with carvings of stars on the [[planisphere]] of the Chinese sky on a stone plate; it is done accurately based on observations, and it shows the supernova of the year of 1054 in Taurus.&lt;ref name="Selin2008"/&gt;

Influenced by European astronomy during the late [[Ming dynasty]], charts depicted more stars but retained the traditional constellations. Newly observed stars were incorporated as supplementary to old constellations in the southern sky, which did not depict the traditional stars recorded by ancient Chinese astronomers.

Historically, the origins of the constellations of the northern and southern skies are distinctly different. Most northern constellations date to antiquity, with names based mostly on Classical Greek legends.&lt;ref name="Norton14th"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of these constellations has survived in the form of [[star charts]], whose oldest representation appears on the statue known as the [[Farnese Atlas]], based perhaps on the star catalogue of the Greek astronomer [[Hipparchus]].&lt;ref name="Bradley2005"&gt;{{cite journal

Some southern constellations had long names that were shortened to more usable forms; e.g. Musca Australis became simply Musca.&lt;ref name="Norton14th" /&gt;

Some of the early constellations were never universally adopted. Stars were often grouped into constellations differently by different observers, and the arbitrary constellation boundaries often led to confusion as to which constellation a celestial object belonged. Before astronomers delineated precise boundaries (starting in the 19th century), constellations generally appeared as ill-defined regions of the sky.&lt;ref name="Norton2nd"&gt;{{cite book

The 1603 star atlas "[[Uranometria]]" of [[Johann Bayer]] assigned stars to individual constellations and formalized the division by assigning a series of Greek and Latin letters to the stars within each constellation.  These are known today as [[Bayer designation]]s.&lt;ref name="Swerdlow1986"&gt;{{cite journal

===Origin of the southern constellations===

[[File:Planisphæri cœleste.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[celestial chart|celestial map]] from the [[Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography|golden age of Netherlandish cartography]], by the Dutch cartographer [[Frederik de Wit]].]]

The southern sky, below about −65° [[declination]], was only partially catalogued by ancient Babylonians, Egyptian, Greeks, Chinese, and Persian astronomers of the north. Knowledge that northern and southern star patterns differed goes back to Classical writers, who describe, for example, the [[Exploration of Africa|African circumnavigation]] expedition commissioned by Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II in c. 600 BC and those of [[Hanno the Navigator]] in c. 500 BC. However, much of this history was lost with the [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The history of southern constellations is not straightforward.  Different groupings and different names were proposed by various observers, some reflecting national traditions or designed to promote various sponsors. Southern constellations were important from the 14th to 16th centuries, when sailors used the stars for [[celestial navigation]]. Italian explorers who recorded new southern constellations include [[Andrea Corsali]], [[Antonio Pigafetta]], and [[Amerigo Vespucci]].&lt;ref name="Allen1899" /&gt;

Many of the [[88 modern constellations|88 IAU-recognized constellations]] in this region first appeared on celestial globes developed in the late 16th century by [[Petrus Plancius]], based mainly on observations of the Dutch navigators [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Several modern proposals have not survived. The French astronomers [[Pierre Lemonnier]] and [[Joseph Lalande]], for example, proposed constellations that were once popular but have since been dropped. The northern constellation [[Quadrans Muralis]] survived into the 19th century (when its name was attached to the [[Quadrantid]] meteor shower), but is now divided between [[Boötes]] and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].

===88 modern constellations===
{{Main|IAU designated constellations}}
A general list of 88 constellations was produced for the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; It is roughly based on the traditional Greek constellations listed by Ptolemy in his ''Almagest'' in the 2nd century and [[Aratus]]' work ''Phenomena'', with early modern modifications and additions (most importantly introducing constellations covering the parts of the southern sky unknown to Ptolemy) by Petrus Plancius (1592, 1597/98 and 1613), [[Johannes Hevelius]] (1690) and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1763),&lt;ref name="iau-const"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Constellations |url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/ |publisher=IAU – [[International Astronomical Union]] |accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm |title=Constellation names, abbreviations and sizes |author=Ian Ridpath |access-date= 30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/almagest.htm |title=Star Tales – The Almagest |author=Ian Ridpath |accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who named fourteen constellations and renamed a fifteenth one.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin-Madison"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/Lacaille.html|title=Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1713–1762)|website=Department of Astronomy. University of Wisconsin-Madison|access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Lacaille studied the stars of the southern hemisphere from 1750 until 1754 from [[Cape of Good Hope]], when he was said to have observed more than 10,000 stars using a {{convert |0.5|in|mm}} [[refracting telescope]].&lt;ref name="Wisconsin-Madison" /&gt;

In 1922, [[Henry Norris Russell]] produced a general list of 88 constellations and some useful abbreviations for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/iaulist1.htm| title = The original names and abbreviations for constellations from 1922| accessdate = 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these constellations did not have clear borders between them. In 1928, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) formally accepted [[88 modern constellations]], with contiguous boundaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/boundaries.htm| title = Constellation boundaries. | accessdate = 24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; along vertical and horizontal lines of [[right ascension]] and [[declination]] developed by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugene Delporte]] that, together, cover the entire celestial sphere;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lachièze-ReyLuminet2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Lachièze-Rey|author2=Jean-Pierre Luminet|author3=Bibliothèque Nationale de France. Paris|title=Celestial Treasury: From the Music of the Spheres to the Conquest of Space|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0ZFXiNn62ZEC&amp;pg=PA80|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80040-2|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; this list was finally published in 1930.&lt;ref name="IAU1928"/&gt; Where possible, these modern constellations usually share the names of their Graeco-Roman predecessors, such as [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] or [[Scorpius]]. The aim of this system is area-mapping, i.e. the division of the celestial sphere into contiguous fields.&lt;ref name="iau-const" /&gt; Out of the 88 modern constellations, 36 lie predominantly in the northern sky, and the other 52 predominantly in the southern.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The boundaries developed by Delporte used data that originated back to [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] [[B1875.0]], which was when [[Benjamin A. Gould]] first made his proposal to designate boundaries for the celestial sphere, a suggestion on which Delporte based his work. The consequence of this early date is that because of the [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] of the [[equinox]]es, the borders on a modern star map, such as epoch [[J2000]], are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal.&lt;ref&gt;A.C.

Leggett, [http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/VI/49/constell.pdf "A Catalogue of Constellation Boundary Data"], (Centre de Donneés astronomiques de Strasbourg, February 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; This effect will increase over the years and centuries to come.

== Dark cloud constellations ==
{{further|Great Rift (astronomy)}}
The Great Rift, a series of dark patches in the [[Milky Way]], is more visible and striking in the [[southern hemisphere]] than in the northern. It vividly stands out when conditions are otherwise so dark that the Milky Way's central region casts shadows on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Joe|title=A Great Week to See the Milky Way|url=http://www.space.com/7270-great-week-milky.html|publisher=Space|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures have discerned shapes in these patches and have given names to these "dark cloud constellations". Members of the [[Inca]] civilization identified various dark areas or [[dark nebula]]e in the Milky Way as animals and associated their appearance with the seasonal rains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/andes/inca.nightsky.html|title=Night sky|website=Astronomy.pomona.edu|accessdate=12 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216041003/http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/andes/inca.nightsky.html|archive-date=16 December 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dearborn |first1=D.S.P. |last2=White |first2=R.E. |title=The "Torreon" of Machu Picchu as an Observatory |journal=Archaeoastronomy |volume=14 |date=1983 |issue= 5|page=S37 |bibcode=1983JHAS...14...37D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krupp |first1=Edwin |title=Echoes of the Ancient Skies |date=1994 |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. |location=Mineola |isbn=978-0486428826 |pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy]] also describes dark cloud constellations, the most famous being the "emu in the sky" whose head is formed by the [[Coalsack]], a dark nebula, instead of the stars.&lt;ref name="Bordeleau2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordeleau|first=André G. |title=Flags of the Night Sky: When Astronomy Meets National Pride|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NSu5BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-0929-8|pages=124–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JohannesVermeer-TheAstronomer(1668).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'', 1668, by [[Johannes Vermeer]]]]

An '''astronomer''' is a [[scientist]] in the field of [[astronomy]] who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of [[Earth]]. They observe [[astronomical object]]s such as [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[comet]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] – in either [[observational astronomy|observational]] (by analyzing the data) or [[theoretical astronomy]]. Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include [[planetary science]], solar astronomy, the origin or [[stellar evolution|evolution of stars]], or the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]]. Related but distinct subjects like [[physical cosmology]], which studies the [[Universe]] as a whole.

Astronomers usually fall under either of two main types: observational and [[scientific theory|theoretical]]. Observational astronomers make direct [[observation]]s of celestial objects and analyze the data. In contrast, theoretical astronomers create and investigate [[Conceptual model|model]]s of things that cannot be observed. Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle, astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form, evolve, and die. They use these data to create models or [[simulation]]s to theorize how different celestial objects work.

Further subcategories under these two main [[branches of science|branches]] of astronomy include planetary astronomy, [[galactic astronomy]], or physical cosmology.

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Sagan planetary orbits2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Carl Sagan]] on the set of ''[[Cosmos]]'']] --&gt;
[[History of astronomy|Historically]], astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of [[phenomena]] in the sky, while [[astrophysics]] attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws. Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms "astronomer" and "astrophysicist" are interchangeable. Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[physics]] or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Becoming an Astronomer |accessdate=29 March 2009 |publisher=NOAO | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090403101540/http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html| archivedate= 3 April 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory.

The number of professional astronomers in the [[United States]] is actually quite small. The [[American Astronomical Society]], which is the major organization of professional astronomers in [[North America]], has approximately 7,000 members. This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, [[geology]], and [[engineering]], whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aas.org/ |title=American Astronomical Society Home |accessdate=14 August 2009 |publisher=AAS| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090802044012/http://aas.org/|archive-date= 2 August 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/about/ |title=About IAU |accessdate=14 August 2009 |publisher=IAU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a [[telescope]] through the dark hours of the night, it is far more common to use a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the [[light]] is added over time. Before CCDs, [[photographic plates]] were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year. Analysis of observed phenomena, along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe, takes the majority of observational astronomers' time.

Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes [[planetarium]]s as a public service to encourage interest in the field.

Those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths, sciences and computing in high school. Taking courses that teach how to research, write and present papers are also invaluable. In college/university most astronomers get a PhD in astronomy or physics.

== Amateur astronomers == 
{{main|Amateur astronomy}}
While there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers, the field is popular among [[amateurs]]. Most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host [[star party|star parties]]. The [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/about.html |title=About Us |accessdate=29 March 2009 |publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225074145/http://astrosociety.org/about.html| archivedate= 25 February 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any [[hobby]], most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to [[stargazing]] and reading the latest developments in research. However, amateurs span the range from so-called "armchair astronomers" to the very ambitious, who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.

      <text bytes="2527" xml:space="preserve">The '''Baade-Wesselink method''' is a method for determining the distance of a [[Cepheid variable]] star suggested by [[Walter Baade]] in 1926 and further developed by [[Adriaan Wesselink]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Adriaan Wesselink]] |title=The observations of brightness, colour and radial velocity of δ Cephei and the pulsation hypothesis (Errata: 10 258, 310) |journal=[[Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands]]|date=1946 |volume=10 |pages=91–100 |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1946BAN....10...91W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original method the color of the star at various points during its period of variation is used to determine its [[surface brightness]]. Then, knowing the [[apparent magnitude]] at these points in time the [[angular diameter]] can be calculated. Measurements are also taken of the [[radial velocity]] using [[Doppler spectroscopy]]. This allows one to determine the speed at which the front surface of the star moves toward or away from us at various points in the cycle. Since the difference between this and the average speed is the derivative of the radius, one obtains the variation in radius. Combining this with the change in angular diameter gives the distance. It is now possible to measure the angular diameter of the pulsating star directly using optical [[Astronomical interferometer|interferometers]], allowing a more accurate measurement of the star's distance. This newer technique is known as the geometric Baade–Wesselink method.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web |title=Baade–Wesselink method |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095438691 |website=Oxford Reference |accessdate=4 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related technique is the '''expanding photosphere method''', which can be used to determine the distance to [[Type II supernova]]e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirshner |first1=R.

Unlike other measures of time such as temperature, redshift, particle horizon, or Hubble horizon, the cosmic time (similar and complementary to the comoving coordinates) is blind to the expansion of the universe.

There are two main ways for establishing a reference point for the cosmic time. The most trivial way is to take the present time as the cosmic reference point (sometimes referred to as the lookback time).

Alternatively, the [[Big Bang]] may be taken as reference to define &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as the '''age of the universe''', also known as '''time since the big bang'''. The current physical cosmology estimates [[age of the universe|the present age]] as 13.8 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/24054-how-old-is-the-universe.html How Old is the Universe?]&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; doesn't necessarily have to correspond to a physical event (such as the [[cosmological singularity]]) but rather it refers to the point at which the scale factor would vanish for a standard cosmological model such as [[ΛCDM]]. For instance, in the case of inflation, i.e. a non-standard cosmology, the hypothetical moment of big bang is still determined using the benchmark cosmological models which may coincide with the end of the inflationary epoch. For inflationary models, it is not possible to establish a well defined origin of time before the big bang since the universe does not require a beginning event in such models. For technical purposes, concepts such as the average temperature of the universe (in units of eV) or the particle horizon are used when the early universe is the objective of a study since understanding the interaction among particles is more relevant than their time coordinate or age.

Cosmic time is the standard time coordinate for specifying the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker solutions]] of [[Einstein's equations]].

The village of Toruń existed in ancient times on Europe's natural trade crossroads, close to the "amber trail" used by the ancient Greek and Roman traders, and for crossing or floating down the river Vistula (rafts – "flisacy").  With time the New village region was added to the Old Village of Toruń.  Chronicler Jan Długosz writes that Toruń in 1192 was used by Polish Princes as a rallying point for military actions against the indigenous pagan Prussians, who periodically invaded the Roman Catholic Polish Kingdom (established 966 A.D.) of Europe under the protection of the Vatican. Subsequently, half a century before 1192, the very first two Teutonic Knights in 1231 came to the already existing two adjacent fortified but separate Old and New villages of Toruń. Teutonic Knights thus neither found the villages nor built the city of Toruń, but only built the small Teutonic Order castle that had to wedge itself in the shape of an architectural sliver into the existing walls of Toruń's Villages  (L. A.  Birkenmajer, 1923, p.91).  Matthäus Merian's city plan from 1652 A.D. shows the earlier built Old Village and the later built New Village, each with it's own defense walls, with the small Teutonic castle in-between.  The Old City ruled the New City through a series of restricting laws. The horrifying, oppressive, and much hated castle of Teutonic Knights was captured and destroyed by the citizens of Toruń in 1454 A.D.  Copernicus’ father with Polish Royal emisaries arrived and participated in the castle capture and destruction – according to the writing of Toruń's Teutonic chronicler (Birkenmajer, 1923, p.108-ref: Toeppen).   The ancestral Polish Toruń was determined to liberate itself and return back to Poland, and under the Polish King, Casimir IV Jagiellon.  After the destruction of the castle (night of 6th onto 7th of February 1454 A.D.), and the expulsion of Teutonic Knights, both competing villages joined and became a single entity-the City of Toruń.  Toruń was thought to be under the protection of an angel, and an angel was placed above city emblems after the capture of the Teutonic Knights castle, which saved Toruń from Teutonic Knights during the subsequent “Thirteen Year’ War” (1454-1466).  Incorporating the angel into the city's heraldic shield is explained by citizens asking  and receiving God’s protection and help during the prolonged war with the Teutonic Knights.

Osada Toruń istniała w antycznych czasach jako naturalne skrzyżowanie dróg handlowych Europy, blisko "szlaku bursztynowego" którego używali antyczni Grecy i Rzymianie, do przeprawy przez rzekę, i to spływu Wisłą (tratwy – "flisacy").  Pól wieku przed tym jak dwoje Krzyżaków w 1231 przyjechało do istniejącej osady Toruń, kronikarz Jan Długosz pisze że Toruń w 1192 był miejscem zebrania wojsk Polskich Książąt na militarne wyprawy przeciw pogańskim Prusom którzy często napadali na Chrześcijańskie Polskie Królestwo (założone  966 A.D.) – Krzyżacy nie założyli ani osady ani miasta Toruń, a tylko wybudowali zamek Krzyżacki przy Toruniu (L. A.  Birkenmajer, 1923, s.91).  Najstarszy i najbardziej dokładny istniejący plan miasta Torunia to perspektywiczny widok według Mateusza Meriana  z 1641 A.D.  Pomiędzy Starym Miastem i Nowym Miastem, każdy ze swoimi murami obronnymi, wciska się ostrym klinem powierzchnia horroru w później zbudowanego i bardzo znienawidzonego Zamku Krzyżackiego – zamku zniszczonego przez mieszkańców Torunia w 1454 A.D. roku, którzy chcieli żeby miasto Toruń przez petycję wróciło do Polski i podlegało Polskiej Koronie króla Kazimierza IV Jagiellończka.  Kopernika ojciec wraz z emisariuszami Króla Polski przybył do Torunia i uczestniczył w zdobyciu i zniszczeniu zamku Krzyżackiego (Birkenmajer, 1923, s.108, ref: Toeppen).  Po zniszczeniu zamku (noc z 6 na 7 Luty, 1454 A.D.), i po wydaleniu Krzyżaków, oba konkurujące miasta połączyły się w jedno miasto – Toruń.  Toruń jest postrzegany jako pod protekcją anioła.  Toruń włożył anioła nad herbem miasta po zwycięstwie nad Krzyżakami.  Jest to element który wyszczególnia herb Torunia oddzielnie od innych herbów miast Polskich.  Anioł po raz pierwszy pokazał się nad herbem Torunia i na wielu budynkach po zniszczeniu Zamku Krzyżackiego w 1454 roku, podczas wynikłej “Trzynastoletniej Wojny” w 15-tym wieku (1454-1466), i istnieje do dzisiaj.  Włączenie anioła do herbu miasta jest tłumaczone prośbami mieszkańców o pomoc i obronę od Boga podczas długiej wojny z Krzyżakami.}}

== History ==
In 1600, Johannes Kepler met and began working with [[Tycho Brahe]] at [[Benátky nad Jizerou|Benátky]], a town north of [[Prague]] where Brahe's new observatory was being built. Brahe assigned Kepler the task of modeling the motion of Mars using only data that Brahe had collected himself.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gingerich|first=Owen|date=2005|title=Tycho and Kepler: Solid Myth versus Subtle Truth|journal=Social Research|volume=72|pages=77–106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the death of Brahe in 1601, all of Brahe's data was willed to Kepler.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hellman|first=C. Doris|date=1975-01-01|title=5.5.

=== Predecessors ===

==== Ptolemy ====
[[File:Ptolemaic elements.svg|thumb|Ptolemy's planetary model showing the deferent and epicycle as dashed lines and the Earth and equant equidistant to the center of the deferent.|alt=]]
[[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy's]] planetary model consisted of a stationary earth surrounded by fixed circles, called [[Deferent and epicycle|deferents]], which carried smaller, [[Rotation|rotating]] circles called [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]]. Planets rotated on the epicycles as the epicycles traveled along the deferent. Ptolemy shifted the Earth away from the center of the deferent and introduced another point, the [[equant]], equidistant to the deferent's center on the opposite side of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Optimizing the Ptolemaic Model of Planetary and Solar Motion|last=Rushkin|first=Illia|date=2015|arxiv = 1502.01967}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Vicarious Hypothesis uses a circular orbit for Mars and reintroduces a form of the equant to describe the motion of Mars with constant [[Angular velocity|angular speed]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==== Copernicus ====
[[File:Copernican heliocentrism theory diagram.svg|thumb|Copernican planetary model showing the Sun at the center of all circular orbits.|alt=|left]][[Nicolaus Copernicus]] broke from the [[geocentric model]] of Ptolemy by placing the Sun at the center of his planetary model. However, Copernicus retained circular orbits for the planets and added an [[orbit]] for the Earth, insisting that the Earth revolved around the Sun. The Sun was positioned off-center of the orbits but was still contained within all orbits. 

Kepler adopted Copernican heliocentrism in the construction of the Vicarious Hypothesis so that his measurements of the distances to Mars were taken relative to the Sun.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{clear}}

== Development ==
Kepler's construction of the Vicarious Hypothesis was based on a circular orbit for Mars and a heliocentric model for the planets.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=4. Kepler's Archetypes and the Astronomia nova|date=2009-12-31|work=Kepler's Philosophy and the New Astronomy|volume=|pages=69–98|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400831098|doi=10.1515/9781400831098.69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After receiving [[Longitude|longitudinal]] observation data from Tycho Brahe, Kepler had twelve observations, two being his own, in which Mars was at [[Opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kleiner|first=Scott A.|date=1983-12-01|title=A new look at Kepler and abductive argument|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A|volume=14|issue=4|pages=279–313|doi=10.1016/0039-3681(83)90009-2|bibcode=1983SHPS...14..279K|issn=0039-3681}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these twelve observations, Kepler chose four to form the basis of the Vicarious Hypothesis because they had a relatively uniform distribution across his proposed circular orbit for Mars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this sense, the Vicarious Hypothesis functions as a fit to observational data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whiteside|first=D. T.|date=1974-02-01|title=Internationales Kepler-Symposium Weil der Stadt 1971. Referate und diskussionen: F. Krafft, K. Meyer and B. Sticker, ed. H.A. Gerstenberg: Hildesheim, 1973. xii + 490 pp. DM 160|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A|volume=4|issue=4|pages=387–392|doi=10.1016/0039-3681(74)90010-7|issn=0039-3681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kepler used these four observations to determine the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricities]] of the Sun and equant of his proposed orbit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Unlike the Ptolemaic System, in which the Earth and equant were assumed equidistant to the center of the orbit, the Vicarious Hypothesis placed the equant where the time and location of the observation would match.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Using the Vicarious Hypothesis, Kepler determined the eccentricities of the Sun and equant to be 11,332 and 7,232 arbitrary units, respectively, for the Martian orbital [[radius]] of 100,000 units. Using these positions for the Sun and equant, the model constructed using the Vicarious Hypothesis agreed with the twelve observations within [[Minute and second of arc|2' of arc]], a level of accuracy better than any other previous model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the heliocentric longitudes of this model proved to be accurate, distances from the Sun to Mars, or [[Galactic coordinate system|latitudes]] of Mars, challenged the model. In his book, ''Astronomia Nova'', Kepler determined that the eccentricity of the Sun, based on latitudinal oppositions, should be between a range of 8,000 and 9,943, conflicting with the eccentricity of 11,332 determined by the Vicarious Hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To accommodate the latitudinal data, Kepler modified the Vicarious Hypothesis to include a [[Bisection|bisected eccentricity]], making the Sun and equant equidistant to the center of the orbit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This resolved the error in the latitudes of Mars but introduced a longitudinal error of 8' of arc in some parts of the Mars orbit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While an 8' error still had better accuracy than previous models, corresponding to approximately one-fourth the [[diameter]] of the [[Moon]], Kepler rejected the Vicarious Hypothesis because he did not believe it was accurate enough to model the true orbit of Mars.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Historical Significance ==
The errors in latitude and longitude of the Mars orbit made Kepler realize that false assumptions were made using the Vicarious Hypothesis. In particular, Kepler amended the hypothesis to exclude the circular orbit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kepler realized that he could fix the error by reducing the spread of the central region of the circular orbit, creating an [[ellipse]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He used calculations previously made with the Vicarious Hypothesis to confirm the elliptical orbit for Mars.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kepler published his results in ''Astronomia Nova'', in which he introduces the elliptical orbit for planets as his first law of planetary motion.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text bytes="2748" xml:space="preserve">'''Solar longitude''' (the [[ecliptic longitude]] of the sun) in effect describes the position of the earth in its orbit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=David Darling |title=Solar longitude |url=https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/solar_longitude.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; being zero at the moment of the [[vernal equinox]]{{dn|date=May 2020}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Solar longitueds – 2019 |url=https://www.imo.net/resources/solar-longitude-tables/solar-longitudes-2019/ |publisher=[[International Meteor Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is based on how far the earth has moved in its orbit since the equinox, it is a measure of what time of the [[tropical year]] (the year of seasons) we are in, but without the inaccuracies of a calendar date, which is perturbed by leap years and calendar imperfections.

Solar longitude is especially used in the field of [[meteor shower]]s, because a particular meteor shower is caused by a stream of small particles very close to the elliptical orbit of a [[comet]], or former comet. This means that the shower occurs when the earth reaches a particular point in its own orbit, designated by the solar longitude.

The value of the solar longitude, like any ecliptic longitude, depends on the [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] being used. The solar longitude for a given meteor shower would therefore not be constant if the current date were used as the epoch. For this reason, a standard epoch is used, usually J2000.

Solar longitude can also be used for other planets, such as Mars. This gives a way of saying what time of year it is on that planet.
&lt;ref name=Planetary&gt;{{cite web |title=Mars' Calendar |url=https://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/mars/mars-calendar.html |publisher=[[The Planetary Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar longitude does not increase linearly with time, the deviation being larger the greater the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the orbit. For instance, here are the dates for multiples of 90° solar longitude on Mars in the mid 1950s:&lt;ref name=Planetary/&gt;

   0° 11 Apr '55
                 199 Earth days
  90° 27 Oct '55
                 183 Earth days
 180° 27 Apr '56
                 147 Earth days
 270° 21 Sep '56
                 158 Earth days
   0° 26 Feb '57
          Total: 687 Earth days

The Martian year is divided into 12 Martian months of unequal duration, with the breakpoints being at solar longitudes that are multiples of 30°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Martian Seasons and Solar Longitude |url=http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/mars/time/solar_longitude.html |publisher=[[Jussieu University|Sorbonne University, Jussieu campus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''H2356-309''' is a [[blazar]] (a type of [[active galactic nucleus]]) located behind the [[Sculptor Wall]].

==Discovery==
Using the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and the [[XMM-Newton]], scientists have detected the [[warm-hot intergalactic medium]] (WHIM) between the galaxies in the [[Sculptor Wall]]. Scientists observed the absorption of a background light source in the warm-hot intergalactic medium. This background source is the blazer H2356-309.

==Application==
In data from the paper, CONFIRMATION OF X-RAY ABSORPTION BY WARM-HOT INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM IN THE SCULPTOR WALL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fang |first1=Taotao |title=Confirmation of X-Ray Absorption by Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium in the Sculptor Wall |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=714 |issue=2 |pages=1715–1724 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/714/2/1715 |year=2010 |bibcode=2010ApJ...714.1715F |arxiv=1001.3692 }}&lt;/ref&gt; characteristics of this absorption in the sculptor wall by the oxygen atoms in particular, are similar to the absorption of the oxygen atoms in warm-hot intergalactic medium, giving scientists more assurance they can find other sources that compare to warm-hot intergalactic medium. There are also similarities in the predicted temperature and density of the warm-hot intergalactic medium compared to the Sculptor Wall.

'''''Star Party Sri Lanka''''', commonly known as the "Star Party" is an astronomical observation competition held in Sri Lanka since 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.starparty.lk/|title=Star Party'20 {{!}} Sri Lanka® - The Largest Astronomy Event in South Asia|website=Star Party {{!}} Sri Lanka®|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is the longest-running inter-school astronomical observation competition in Sri Lanka. It happens annually at the University of Peradeniya premises typically in the first quarter of the year. However, in some years it was held in the other periods of the year due to various reasons. Star Party considered the most important event in the Sri Lankan amateur astronomical calendar.

== Observation competition ==

Star Party night sky observation competition is the main focus event of the entire Star Party. High school students from all around the country teamed up and compete for the title "Best school-based astronomical observation team of the year" and the Star Party challenge trophy. A team consist of 5 members from the same school and there can be maximum of two teams (namely A and B) can compete from one school. The competition held under 6 sections as follows&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-events/star-party-2019-kandy-sri-lanka/|title=Star Party 2019 {{!}} Kandy, Sri Lanka|website=Sky &amp; Telescope|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 

* Best in moon mapping.
* Best in planetary observation.
* Best in deep-sky observation and constellation mapping.
* Best in observational astronomy (Theory).
* Best in celestial measurements.
* Best in spot-test and viva round.

The highest-scoring team of each of those sections wins the sub-trophy for the respective titles. The team that has the highest total score for all these sections wins the Star Party Challenge trophy and crowned as the Champions of the Star Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://astronomerswithoutborders.org/member-reports/4758-star-party-2019-kandy-sri-lanka-successfully-concluded.html|title=Star Party 2019 {{!}} Kandy, Sri Lanka - Successfully Concluded|website=astronomerswithoutborders.org|access-date=2020-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''To the Stars: Costa Rica in NASA''''' (2018) is a book by Canadian writer Bruce James Callow and Costa Rican writer Ana Luisa Monge Naranjo published by Editorial Tecnológica de [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tec.ac.cr/hoyeneltec/2018/08/22/editorial-tecnologica-llega-40-anos-lo-celebra-tres-importantes-obras|title=Editorial Tecnológica llega a 40 años y lo celebra con tres importantes obras|last=Bravo|first=Noemy Chinchilla|date=2018-08-22|website=Hoy en el TEC|language=es|access-date=2020-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book documents the lives of the Costa Ricans who have worked for the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] ( NASA) up to the date of the book's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ticotimes.net/2018/09/27/reaching-for-the-stars|title=Reaching for the stars|website=The Tico Times Costa Rica|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story ==
The stories documented in the book share common themes including triumph over adversity and the importance of perseverance when faced with seemingly impossible obstacles. The book is laid out in an easy to read interview format making it accessible to young readers looking for career paths to aerospace careers. ''To the Stars: Costa Rica in NASA'' reveals the diversity of the important jobs Costa Ricans perform at NASA which serves as a source of pride and inspiration including in the wider Hispanic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.larepublica.net/noticia/conozca-a-los-11-ticos-que-han-pasado-por-la-nasa|title=Conozca a los 11 ticos que han pasado por la NASA|website=www.larepublica.net|language=es|access-date=2020-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public, and in particular educators focused on STEAM, have responded very positively to the book, both in Costa Rica and other countries including Canada, The USA and Mexico. 

== Outreach ==
Since the book was published in August 2018 the authors have embarked on an ongoing outreach program to share the positive messages as widely as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/calgary-teacher-tours-the-province-inspiring-under-privileged-youth-in-stem-education|title=Calgary teacher inspires under-privileged youth in STEM education {{!}} Calgary Herald|last=August 20|first=Eva Ferguson Updated|last2=2019|date=2019-08-11|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2020 over 60 workshops and web conferences had been delivered including a presentation at the Space Explorers Education Conference (SEEC)#SEEC2020 in [[Houston]] Texas, with the participation of [[Sandra Cauffman]], Acting Director of NASA's Earth Science Division. A high priority of the authors is to reach out to under-serviced populations and they have done workshops with students in Canadian First Nations communities, orphanages and in a center for underage mothers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ticotimes.net/2019/05/13/space-ticos-two-costa-ricans-make-headlines-at-nasa|title=Space Ticos: Two Costa Ricans make headlines at NASA|website=The Tico Times Costa Rica|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;The NASA Costa Ricans including engineers Andres Mora and Alfredo Valverde and oceanographer Joaquin Chaves have spoken to students at their workshops several times via web conferences.

A potentially '''habitable exoplanet''' is a hypothetical type of planet that could be habitable for humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/habex/|title=Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx)|website=www.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of March 2020, a total of 55 potentially habitable exoplanets have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog|title=The Habitable Exoplanets Catalog - Planetary Habitability Laboratory @ UPR Arecibo|website=phl.upr.edu|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of those, one is believed to be Sub-terran (Mars-size), 20 Terran (Earth-size) and 34 Super Terran (Super Earths).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog|title=The Habitable Exoplanets Catalog - Planetary Habitability Laboratory @ UPR Arecibo|website=phl.upr.edu|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most potentially habitable exoplanet discovered so far is Teegarden b, with an [[Earth Similarity Index]] of 0.93.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/teegarden%27s_b/|title=The Extrasolar Planet Encyclopaedia — Teegarden's b|website=exoplanet.eu|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main feature of potentially habitable exoplanets is that they have to be located in the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] of their stellar systems.

== Characteristics ==

=== Mass ===
In order to be potentially habitable, an exoplanet would have to have a mass between 0.1 and 10 Earth masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raymond|first=S. N.|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/895337|title=High-resolution simulations of the final assembly of Earth-like planets 2: water delivery and planetary habitability|last2=Quinn|first2=T.|last3=Lunine|first3=J.

=== Radius ===
The radius of a habitable exoplanet would range between 0.5 and 2.5 Earth radii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2014/01/aa22293-13.pdf|title=On the radius of habitable planets|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperature ===
The temperature among the habitable exoplanets discovered so far range from 182 degrees Kelvin (Kepler 186 f) and 285 degrees Kelvin (Tau Ceti e).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog|title=The Habitable Exoplanets Catalog - Planetary Habitability Laboratory @ UPR Arecibo|website=phl.upr.edu|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Host star ==
It is believed that F, G, K and M-type star could host habitable exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/habex/|title=Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx)|website=www.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; G-type stars would allow to host the exoplanets most similar to Earth, that is, Earth-like planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petigura|first=Erik A.|last2=Howard|first2=Andrew W.|last3=Marcy|first3=Geoffrey W.|date=2013-11-26|title=Prevalence of Earth-size planets orbiting Sun-like stars|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=110|issue=48|pages=19273–19278|doi=10.1073/pnas.1319909110|pmid=24191033|pmc=3845182|arxiv=1311.6806|bibcode=2013PNAS..11019273P|issn=0027-8424|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; K-type stars would provide the necessary conditions for [[Superhabitable planet|super habitable exoplanets]], which are exoplanets that could be more habitable than Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heller|first=René|last2=Armstrong|first2=John|date=2014|title=Superhabitable Worlds|journal=Astrobiology|volume=14|issue=1|pages=50–66|doi=10.1089/ast.2013.1088|pmid=24380533|issn=1531-1074|arxiv=1401.2392|bibcode=2014AsBio..14...50H}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2020, only one potentially habitable exoplanet has been found orbiting a F-type star: Kepler-1632 b.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/2278/kepler-1632-b/|title=Exoplanet-catalog|website=Exoplanet Exploration: Planets Beyond our Solar System|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M-type stars also considered possible hosts of habitable exoplanets, even those with flares such as Proxima b. However, it is important to bear in mind that flare stars could greatly reduce the habitability of exoplanets by eroding their atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/habex/|title=Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx)|website=www.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UGC 8837''' (also known as '''Holmberg IV''') is a [[dwarf galaxy]] located in the constellation of [[Ursa Major]], 24 million light years away from [[Earth]]. It is a member of the [[M101 Group]], a group containing several galaxies orbiting the largest, the [[Pinwheel Galaxy]] (M101). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.messier.seds.org/more/m101gr.html|title=The M101 group of galaxies|website=www.messier.seds.org|access-date=2020-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible UGC 8837 is one of the galaxies that interacted with the [[Pinwheel Galaxy]] and, together with [[NGC 5474]] and [[NGC 5477]], initiated a burst of star formation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stoyan|first=Ronald|url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=x2VuBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1101&amp;lpg=PT1101&amp;dq=ugc+8837&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v8lPX04NrE&amp;sig=ACfU3U2kcvlQDqILtjGetVqnV7QWquwI2g&amp;hl=hr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtlu2RiobpAhXxl4sKHXOBAgg4ChDoATAAegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ugc%208837&amp;f=false|title=Atlas of the Messier Objects: Highlights of the Deep Sky|last2=Binnewies|first2=Stefan|last3=Friedrich|first3=Susanne|date=2008-10-27|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-47311-8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cosmic Dawn Center''' is an [[Astronomy]]/[[Cosmology]] research center, founded as a collaboration between the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]] and [[DTU Space]] of the [[Danish Technical University]] (DTU). The center is led by center director and NBI Professor [[Sune Toft]] and center co-director [[Thomas Greve]], Professor at DTU and [[University College London|UCL]].&lt;ref name=greve&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/astrophysics/people/thomas-greve|title=Thomas Greve profile at UCL|work=[[University College London]]|date=15 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main objective of the center is to investigate the period known as the [[Cosmic Dawn]] (the transition period following the [[Cosmic Dark Ages]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.space.com/41550-breaking-of-the-cosmic-dawn.htmll|title=Space.com article on the Cosmic Dawn and the formation of the first stars|date=15 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;), i.e. the [[reionization]] of the Universe and the formation of the first galaxies, through observations as well as through theory and simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://dawn.nbi.ku.dk/about-dawn/|title=Mission Statement|work=Cosmic Dawn Center|date=25 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dginauguration&gt;{{citation|url=https://dg.dk/en/inauguration-of-dawn-the-cosmic-dawn-center/|title=DNRF article on the inauguration of DAWN|work=[[Danish National Research Foundation]]|date=14 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=natureindex&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.natureindex.com/institution-outputs/denmark/cosmic-dawn-center-dawn/5a8656606f5bfb4d6110d93e|title=The Cosmic Dawn Center profile on Nature|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=14 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cosmic Dawn Center also runs two summer programs for mainly U.S. undergraduates, the DAWN-IRES program, funded by [[National Science Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.dawnires.com/|title=DAWN-IRES website|date=14 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/surf|title=Caltech SURF program|date=14 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; program for [[California Institute of Technology]] students&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://announcements.surf.caltech.edu/index.cfm?event=ViewAODetail&amp;id=2218&amp;inFrame=&amp;type=SURF&amp;formType=AO_CIT|title=Caltech SURF Announcement of Opportunity|date=14 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Research ==

Research conducted at the center is focused on the specific period in the history of the Universe known as the [[Cosmic Dawn]]. This largely unexplored period, 300-600 million years after the [[Big Bang]] is when the first stars, black holes and galaxies are believed to have formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.space.com/39837-first-stars-universe-fingerprints-dark-matter.html|title=Cosmic Dawn: Astronomers Find Fingerprints of Universe's First Stars|author=Wall, Mike|date=28 February 2018|website=Space.com|accessdate=15 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.time.com/2012/12/14/cosmic-dawn-hubble-spots-some-granddaddy-galaxies/|work =[[Time Magazine]]|title=Cosmic Dawn: How the Universe's Lights Went On|author=Lemonick, Michael D.|date=14 December 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the observations used by the center originate from the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA), one of the more powerful telescopes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/|title=ALMA homepage|date=15 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/cosmic-dawn/|work=[[National Geographic]]|title=Cosmic Dawn|author=Bhattacharjee, Yudhijit |date=9 March 2019|accessdate=15 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the future, the center aims to mainly use the [[James Webb Space Telescope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/jwst/results/|title=ESA JWST Workshops|date=15 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-s-webb-to-explore-galaxies-from-cosmic-dawn-to-present-day|title=NASA JWST will explore the Cosmic Dawn|date=15 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; (planned to start operating in 2021&lt;ref name=bridenstine-launch&gt;{{cite tweet |author-link=Jim Bridenstine |user=JimBridenstine |number=1012008010150006786 |title=The James Webb Space Telescope will produce first of its kind, world-class science.
